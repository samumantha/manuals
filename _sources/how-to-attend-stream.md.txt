# Attending an livestream workshop

We are glad you would like to attend an livestream workshop.  This page
will help you mentally and physically prepare.

Our workshops are interactive and hands-on, and you will get the most
out of them if you can take part in all exercises, unlike a normal
academic lecture where you mainly listen.  Thus, please read this and
come prepared!

A livestream workshop allow us to reach an unlimited number of people,
at the cost of not being as interactive.  Still, we have solutions:
- You might register to Zoom breakout rooms, which *are* interactive.
- {doc}`HackMD <hackmd-mechanics>` allows you to ask questions anonymously -
  even better than a normal workshop!  Once we have a few tens of people in
  any workshop, people don't ask voice questions anyway.
- In some workshops, you can register for breakout rooms to get
  interactive assistance during the exercise/breakout sessions.



## How it works

- You open the livestream in a web browser.  This is the "TV", it is
  always on.
- If you are attending Zoom exercise session, open this as well.  The
  livestream will tell you when to switch to Zoom, and Zoom will tell
  you when to switch to livestream.  There should only be sound coming
  from one at a time, so you can simply follow the sound.
- If you are not in a organized Zoom exercise session, you can form
  your own mini-Zoom meetings and work together that way.
  Screensharing is a great way to help each other!
- You could just as well organize a in-person session, where you play
  the stream in a meeting room and work together on your computers.
- The livestream is a portrait screenshare, so that it will only take
  up half of your screen (and the other half is for you to work).  (If
  you are in a physical meeting room with a projector or second
  monitor, it can be half the livestream and half the HackMD - this
  will make sense when you see it).



## General prerequisites, software installation, etc.

Check your workshop page for the general setup specific to that
workshop.

- Often, there is something to install.  We usually ask you to install
  things so that your computer is set up to do work later.
- There may be some basic skills, such as the command line shell, to
  review in advance.

**Do the installation and configuration in advance, and double check
it.**  In real workshops, problems here slow us down a lot, and if
you don't prepare, you will immediately fall behind.  If there is a
pre-workshop session for installation, go there if needed.

If all else fails, join the workshop well in advance and ask
for help then.  Usually, there will be enough time to get ready for
the day.



## Take the workshop seriously

It's easy to think "it's just online, it's easy to passively watch".
However, for an interactive experience you do need to take part to get
the most of out it, and our workshops are targeted to that.  If you
read this page and the workshop prerequisites, you should be OK.

*Don't do multiple meetings*, *reserve the entire timeslots on your
calendar*, *attend every session*, *do the preparation*.

On the other hand, the point of livestreaming is that someone can
passively watch without taking a seat from others.  If you want to
watch without interacting, that is OK too!  Please don't take an
interactive seat from others and consider returning actively later.



## Social

Attend with someone!  Register together and try to be in their same
group.  You could even reserve a room and work together.  This will
create a network of learning and practice that will last much longer.

If you can attend a group, that is even better.  You can bring your
own exercise leader to guide you (if the workshop works this way).  Research
shows that groups that have multiple adopters have much more uptake of
new skills.



## Workspace

Get a good, quiet workspace.  Make sure it is comfortable enough to
stay at for a while.

An extra monitor is useful but not required, since there is a lot of
stuff to follow: the stream itself, the lesson webpage, and the window
where you are doing the assignment.  You could also use a second
device to watch the stream.

If you have registered to attend breakout rooms, you'll be expected
to talk at some times and take part, not simply be
quiet and listen all the time.  Try to be in a place where you can
speak without disturbing others.  By the same token, you'll be
listening for a long time, and your ears may get tired of headphones.
If you have good enough external speakers, be somewhere that you can
use them (perhaps only sometimes - when it doesn't interfere with your
microphone.)

If you work in a large office, consider attending from home or in a
meeting room so that you can speak and listen more freely.  If you
need and extra monitor or more comfortable seating space and don't
have that at home, consider working at your office.  Yes, these are
conflicting ideas, you need to find what works best for you.



## Time management

Despite what most people think, attending things online can be harder
than in-person.

Don't schedule overlapping meetings, reserve the entire timeslots,
minimze distractions.  It's easy to think you can do multiple things
at once when doing it online, but really it's a trap.

Join the workshop 10 minutes early to get ready.

There will be breaks, but even long ones go by very fast, and this
gives you limited time to make coffee, eat, etc.  We try to limit
ourselves to half-days because of this, but consider preparing food,
coffee, etc. in advance.

Make sure you take the breaks, walk around some, etc.



## Communication

Most communication goes through [HackMD](hackmd-mechanics). Make sure
that you have it open and practice during the icebreakers.  This is
much better than chat, since you can ask anonymously, you can ask at
the same time as others, and multiple people can answer.  We recommend
you don't use chat, messages tend to get lost if not answered
immediately.





## Final notes

Join the stream 10 minutes in advance.  There is some advance
icebreakers and discussion you can take part in, and you get to breath
before we start.

There is usually discussion after the workshop.  If you want, stick
around and give us immediate feedback and ask more questions.
