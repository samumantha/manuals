# Teaching via livestreaming

We've all done a lot of teaching via Zoom, but the CodeRefinery
livestream is a new concept.  This introduces teachers/helpers to the
idea (and for a detailed reference, see {doc}`coderefinery-mooc`).

Compared to Zoom teaching:

- You are in a Zoom meeting with only instructors/staff
- Someone (not you) captures this meeting and broadcasts it via
  livestream to all the audience.
- The audience can't directly talk with you (but when there is a large
  audience, who does anyway).  Instead, always say things like "What
  do you think?  Write in the HackMD. [proceed to screenshare it and
  discuss answers]"
- You don't need to worry much about managing the audience.  Others do
  this and relay information as you need.
- You should pay attention to the HackMD more.  This doesn't mean all
  the time (co-teachers can do it while you are actively teaching),
  but it should always be kept close.


## Basic meeting setup

There is an "instructor Zoom meeting".  There are no students here,
and everything can and will be captured, recorded, published, and
livestreamed.

* In the call are instructors, the Zoom host, and possibly some other
  helpers who might occasionally comment.
* If you have your camera off, you will *not* appear in the stream.
  So turn your camera off.
* During the breaks/exercise times, the livestream itself (via OBS)
  gets *muted* and *switched to another scene*.  So, you are free to
  unmute, talk, and chat with other instructors.  This is a great way
  to relax and prepare for the next segments!
* By the same token, you can join the meeting during the previous
  break to get all set up.




## Screensharing

You can share your screen normally via Zoom.  The livestream is fixed
to an aspect ratio of 840 pixels wide × 1080 pixels high (this is so
that the learner has half of their screen available).  **You can not
do a full landscape screenshare (nor is this good in other
workshops).**

* In **Zoom**, you can either share one window or Advanced → Share a
  portion of the screen → move the overlay to a landscape view.

* If you have a landscape presentation, just share your whole screen,
  and the OBS operator will scale things properly if it doesn't
  automatically work.  Note that the 4:3 aspect ratio is better than
  16:9, but that usually has black bars


## HackMD and audience feedback

HackMD (or similar document-based things) is our preferred
communication system.  The biggest problem is that it is *too* useful,
and too many people ask questions, which will easily overload you.  To
solve this, we have co-teachers (non-typer can watch HackMD), HackMD
helpers (watch and answer basic questions).

There are several general strategies:
* Occasionally screenshare the HackMD.  This emphasizes to the
  audience that questions there *do* get noticed.
* During Q&A time, go to the HackMD and comment on the most important
  questions.
* Call on co-teachers, "do we have any good questions from HackMD?"
* Co-teachers should be more than willing to bring up relevant
  questions right away.

You can't use Zoom polls and so on.  Instead, use HackMD cleverly.
For example, below you see a poll (people add `o` to make a bar
graph), and a free response.
