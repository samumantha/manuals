# Attending an in-person workshop

We are glad you would like to attend an in-person workshop.  This page
will help you mentally and physically prepare.

Our workshops are interactive and hands-on, and you will get the most
out of them if you can take part in all exercises, unlike a normal
academic lecture where you mainly listen.  Thus, please read this and
come prepared!



## General prerequisites

Check your workshop page for the prerequisites and required software -
this is not duplicated here!



## CodeRefinery-specific

- For most workshops, it is important to be a little bit familiar with
  the command line prompt - not a lot, if you can navigate to
  directories and edit files, you'll be able to make do.  [This Linux
  shell crash course](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell.html)
  ([video](https://youtu.be/56p6xX0aToI)) is enough.
- Basics in one or more programming languages.
- You need to install some software. Please follow links on the
  workshop page.
- It is useful if you have a basic idea of how Git works. We will start from
  the basics anyway, but please go through
  [this Git-refresher material](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/)
  for a basic overview and important configuration steps.
- Make sure that git is configured, and verify the configuration:

## Take the workshop seriously

It's easy to think "it's just a class, it's easy to passively watch".
However, for an interactive workshop you do need to take part to get
the most of out it, and our workshops are targeted to that.  If you
read this page and the workshop prerequisites, you should be OK.



## Social

Attend with someone!  Register together and try to sit near them.
This will create a network of learning and practice that will last
much longer.

If you can attend a group, that is even better.  You can bring your
own exercise leader to guide you (if the workshop works this way).  Research
shows that groups that have multiple adopters have much more uptake of
new skills.



## Computer and equipment

Bring your laptop and charger, of course.  If you use external mice,
etc, it would be good to bring them too.  You'll be on your device a
lot.

Usually, you'll need to look at both the lesson webpage and the window
where you are doing the exercises at the same time.  Consider how you
can arrange windows to do this best.



## Time management

Try your very best to attend the whole workshops; at least don't miss
the early sessions.  Later sessions depend on earlier ones, and it's
easy to get behind.  Tell others this is important so that you can
free your schedule.

Arrive 10 minutes early to get ready.



## Software installation

**Do the installation and configuration in advance, and double check
it.**  In real workshops, problems here slow us down a lot, and if
you don't prepare, you will immediately fall behind.  If there is a
pre-workshop session for installation, go there if needed.

If all else fails, come well in advance and ask for help then.
Usually, there will be enough time to get ready for the day.



## Final notes

Arrive 10 minutes in advance to get set-up.  There is some advance
icebreakers and discussion you can take part in, and you get to breath
before we start.

There is usually discussion after the workshop.  If you want, stick
around and give us immediate feedback and ask more questions.
