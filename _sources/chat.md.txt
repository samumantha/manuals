# CodeRefinery Zulipchat

The [CodeRefinery zulipchat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) is
where our primary discussion, planning, and action takes place.  Many
things are announced only via zulipchat.  This is a public chat and
everybody is welcome to join, no invitation needed, and we explicitly
invite anyone to give ideas in any thread.

The chat is a joint community of CodeRefinery (teaching), NordicHPC
(infrastructure), and Nordic-RSE (usage and software), which are other
Nordic projects about scientific computing which share some of the
same people.  Together, we have a network of all aspects of modern
scientific computing.

Unlike Slack, zulipchat is very heavily threaded, and it is easy to
follow along without being active all the time.  Respond within the
topic (=thread) that is relevant, or make a new thread.  Sometimes you
can find old threads to revive.  Don't worry, everything is flexible
and you'll quickly learn by watching (and don't worry about going
wrong).


## Streams

Once you join the chat, you will be subscribed to some default
streams (a stream is basically a channel).  **The first thing you
should do is join some more streams, depending on your interest.  Join
more streams by clicking gear icon by the steams list on the left side
on that chat, then selecting what you are interested in.**

If you **mute a stream**, you can see the contents if you click on it,
but you won't get notifications.  If you **mute a topic**, it will be
hidden from view but you can later unmute it in your personal
settings.  Under stream settings, you can request email notifications
for all messages in a certain stream (possibly useful for the announce
streams).

CodeRefinery streams:
* **#general**: Any topic and random chat (including for the other
  projects below)
* **#coderefinery**: About the project itself.  CodeRefinery members
  should be in this channel.
* **#lessons**: CodeRefinery lesson discussion, one for each lesson we
  maintain.
* **#workshops**: Organizing workshops and other events.  One topic
  for each event.
* **#workshop-chat**: High-volume staff chat during workshops.  You
  typically join during a workshop, and leave when done to avoid the
  flood.
* **#help**: Ask questions and get advice from others.  Tell
  interesting things you learned via "TIL"s
* **#new members**: Feel free to introduce yourself here
* **#announce**:
* **#infrastructure**: [CodeRefinery
  gitlab](https://coderefinery.org/repository/) talk.


Nordic research software engineer community:
* **#nordic-rse**: Discussion about
  [Nordic-RSE](https://nordic-rse.org)

Nordic HPC:
* **#NordicHPC**: [NordicHPC](https://nordichpc.github.io).
  Discussion about computing infrastructure (not just HPC)

Misc streams in our sphere of influence:
* **#RSHour**: [Research Software
  Hour](https://researchsoftwarehour.github.io) planning
* **#finland**: Finland stuff, we won't complain about others.
* **#Aalto**: Aalto University community, you can reach [Aalto
  Scientific Computing](https://scicomp.aalto.fi) staff there.
* **#hands-on-scicomp**: Discussions about the [Hands-on scientific
  computing course](https://handsonscicomp.readthedocs.io).
* **#RSHour**: the [Research Software
  Hour](https://researchsoftwarehour.github.io) web show.

You can make topical private streams for groups that significantly
overlap with our community.  Currently, Zulip admins can't add
themselves or others to private streams.


## Clients

Zulipchat can be used in a web browser, there's a desktop app, mobile
apps, and even a terminal client installable using ``pip``.

## Reacting and voting

We want everyone to take part in chat and express their thoughts, but
of course people don't want to give pointless agreeing replies (but
you can always welcome to do that, too).  So, we encourage everyone to
use reactions in cases they want to express agreement/disagreement but
not so much they want to send a message.  Common reactions you might
see are üëç, üëé (thumbs up/down, agree with general sentiment), üêô
(`:octopus:`, awesome/amazing/ace), and well, plenty more that are
obvious.

We also use reactions to express some idea of a more concrete
**vote**, to empower people to take an action (otherwise, it is
difficult to get a decision on anything).  This is not formal or
necessarily binding (so it's not really a vote), but a useful
intermediate system for a young project.  If you see a message
proposing something and you want to say, in no uncertain terms, "I
think you should do that" or not, let us know by the following:

* ‚ÜîÔ∏è (+0, `:left_right:`: I see this and am neutral.
* üîº, üîΩ (+1, -1, `:upvote:`, `:downvote:`) or similar: I
   agree/disagree with this.
* ‚è¨, ‚è´ (+2, -2, `:double_up:`, `:double_down:`): I agree/disagree
   with this and am willing to work on making it happen/finding an
   alternative.

If you want to do something, ask for opinions, and a reasonable time
later it seems the sentiment is positive, consider yourself empowered
to do it.  If you are voting, feel free to be creative with emojis or
numbers, but realize that other reactions may not be so explicit.  Note
that if you are negative, you should explain why or alternatives,
otherwise your opinion may not be weighted so much.  The person doing
the thing decides what to do (and this is open source: we find a way
for everyone to do what they need to do).

Do you think you aren't important enough to vote?  That's wrong,
because we are usually interested in the thoughts of outsiders.  We
can see who voted and use that to weight our decision if needed.



## Privacy

All activity (except private steams) should be considered public, and
the data controller is zulipchat.com.  Zulip admins can't add
themselves or others to private streams, but still: there is no
contract guaranteeing confidentiality.
