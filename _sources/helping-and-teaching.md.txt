# Tips for exercise leaders

This page contains the most important general tips for exercise leaders before during and after the workshop. If you have not visited the main introduction page, see {ref}`Exercise leader introduction <helper-intro>`.

> If you aren't sure if you can be an exercise leader: you probably can be one!

## Before the workshop

As an exercise leader, we do not expect you to know all our [CodeRefinery training material](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/) but if you have time:

- Take a look at the exercises of the days you plan to help at. We try to make each exercise self-explanatory, but if you do one
  thing, scan over the exercises and understand the general point of each of them.
- Be ready to introduce yourself in one or two sentences to your breakout room: think about what you
  would like to convey as exercise leader to the classroom. How did (or does) CodeRefinery help you?
- If you are interested, also read through the instructor guides for the lessons (there should be
  a link at the top or sidebar of each lesson).

## During the workshop

### Code of Conduct

Teaching isn't about helping those who are already "in", it is for those who aren't.  Thus, we follow [The Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) for all our interactions before, during and after workshops.

If you see anything that is not supporting an equal learning environment,
please mention it to one of instructors.

### Creating a positive learning environment

As an exercise leader, you have a crucial role during workshops:

- Encourage learners to learn from each other.
- Acknowledge that some of the material can be difficult and that people in your breakoutroom will
  learn more working together.
- Acknowledge when learners are confused and raise it to the instructors.
  Understanding why learners are confused provides useful feedback for
  instructors. You are our eyes and ears.
- As we said, you don't have to know everything, just like learners don't
  necessarily know everything (we don't know everything, either). It's more
  important to be responsive and work together.
- In an online workshop: Turn on your camera, and encourage everyone else to do so as well. Have an introductory round in the first breakout room session, to get to know your group. Whichever strategy you choose for your breakoutroom (see also {ref}`Helping in breakoutrooms <breakout-helpers>`), be present and encourage learners to ask questions.
- In an in-person workshop: Stand up and walk around, try to make rounds by everyone.  If you are
  convenient, students will ask.  If you are sitting in the back, student's
  wont.  Students rarely try to get your attention from across the room if you
  don't look ready.


### Things you should not do in a workshop

- Take over the learner's keyboard (neither physically nor remotely). It is rarely a good idea to type anything
  for your learners and it can be demotivating for the learner because it
  implies you don't think they can do it themselves or that you don't want to
  wait for them. It also wastes a valuable opportunity for them to develop muscle
  memory and other skills that are essential for independent work.  Instead, try
  to have a sticky note pad and pen / use the zoom chat and write the commands that they should type.
- Criticize certain programs, operating systems, or GUI applications, or
  learners who use them. (Excel, Windows, etc.)
- Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool. Regardless of its
  shortcomings, many of your learners may be using that tool. Convincing
  someone to change their practices is much harder when they think you disdain
  them.
- Dive into complex or detailed technical discussion with the one or two people
  in the audience who have advanced knowledge and may not actually need to be
  at the workshop.
- Pretend to know more than you do. People will actually trust you more if you
  are frank about the limitations of your knowledge, and will be more likely to
  ask questions and seek help.
- Use “just”, “easy”, or other demotivating words. These signal to the learner
  that the instructor thinks their problem is trivial and by extension that
  they therefore must be stupid for not being able to figure it out.
- Feign surprise at learners not knowing something. Saying things like “I can't
  believe you don't know X” or “You've never heard of Y?” signals to the
  learner that they do not have some required pre-knowledge of the material you
  are teaching, that they don't belong at the workshop, and it may prevent them
  from asking questions in the future.
