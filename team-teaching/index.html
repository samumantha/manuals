<h1>Team teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#team-teaching" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Listening to someone talk is boring.  Listening to a discussion is
much less so.  “Team teaching” can mean many things, but in this case we
are referring to <strong>two instructors are both actively
involved in lecturing at the same time</strong>, as some sort of conversation
between them.  It is a form of co-teaching.</p>
<p>When it works well, it makes a lecture much more dynamic and
engaging, and reduces the load for each person to plan everything
because you can rely on two minds to do it live.
The difficulty is that it’s our nature to keep talking while teaching,
making a conversation difficult.</p>
<div class="section" id="basics">
<h2>Basics<a class="headerlink" href="#basics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We can’t claim to know the best way to do this yet, but we have seen ways
that work and don’t work.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that you want to keep a constant <em>conversation</em>
going.  This can be a mutual discussion, one person explaining big
concepts and one the details, one person asking
questions and the other answering, or some other combination.</p>
<p>There is less need for the instructors to prepare every single thing,
since you can rely
on the wisdom of the group to get you through most problematic
situations.  In fact, this is good, because then your learners will
see things go slightly wrong and your live solutions (and still not
fall too much behind the schedule, since
two minds are much faster at debugging than one).</p>
<p>With more than one person, there is a risk of seeming uncoordinated
when the team starts talking to decide what to do next.  This is not
all bad, it makes the show seem interactive.  But if it happens too
much, it becomes noticeable.  You could adopt a principle which exists
in many domains: at any time, only one person and only one person is
in control.  Implemented in team teaching, it becomes: <em>you explicitly
know who is in control</em> (the <strong>director</strong>).  <em>This person is
responsible for understanding the audience and checking with other
instructors, but in when you just need to something and it’s not
spontaneously coming, they push it forward.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hints">
<h2>Hints<a class="headerlink" href="#hints" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We can’t tell you what works best for you.  But here are some ideas
that might help you frame the vocabulary and possibilities so that you
can discuss what you want to do.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Roles</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Host</strong>, someone who asks questions to others</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Presenter</strong>, someone who is hands-on giving the demos</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Director</strong>, person with the big perspective, sets the pace, and
makes sure the event moves forward when needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Usually you would have two people.  In the host/presenter
system, either one could be the director, but the host is a
bit more natural.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Equal presenters</strong> can work, but how do you avoid things
dragging on too long since you both are waiting for the other, or
keep restating the same things?</p></li>
<li><p>In a host/presenter system, if you have unequal skill levels,
either role could be the more advanced person.  If the host is
more advance, it is more on the side of “Host is walking the
presenter through the material”.  If the presenter is more
advanced, it is more on the side of “Host is interviewing
presenter to learn how it works as the presenter demos”.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Of course, there are other roles in a workshop.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>HackMD watcher</strong> pays particular attention to the audience
questions.  They can interrupt anytime.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Meeting host</strong> manages the meeting itself (note this is
different from the “host” role above).</p></li>
<li><p>The Director could be completely separate from the people on
screen, and somehow sending signals to the presenters as needed.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If you ever go off-plan, that’s OK.  You can discuss during the
lecture so the audience can know what you are doing and why.  You
<em>want</em> to adjust to the audience more than you usually would.</p></li>
<li><p>Two people works well.  With three, it’s hard to allow everyone to
speak equally and people tend to jump on top of each other in the
gaps.  You could have particular segments where different pairs of
people adopt the main roles.  Or, of course, you can just give it a
try and see how it works.</p></li>
<li><p>Of course, it helps to have a good plan of what you are going to
do.  But if only one person knows that plan, this strategy can still
work, especially if that person is the host.  If the presenter makes
the detailed plan, it should be provided to the host (with suggested
timings) so the host can guide the presenter through the material.</p></li>
<li><p>The less preparation you have, the more useful it is to strictly
define the roles of each person (to ensure someone is in charge of
moving it forward).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please send us more suggestions to add to this list.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preparation">
<h2>Preparation<a class="headerlink" href="#preparation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is one proposed model for preparing for co-teaching:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Talk with your co-teacher.  These hints assume a two-person team.</p></li>
<li><p>Decide what material will be covered, overall timing, strategy, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Divide up the material.  In each section, decide the host and the
presenter.</p></li>
<li><p>Decide who will be the director for each part.  Perhaps a good idea
is to keep it consistent: the host is always the director.</p></li>
<li><p>At least one person prepares the outline (the order of topics to be
presented).  Either host or presenter could prepare it.</p></li>
<li><p>Run as above.  In the typical arrangement, host asks questions to
bring up each point in order.  The presenter could also be the one
who moves from topic to topic, so that host is asking questions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then, just go!  Don’t worry if it’s not perfect, if either person
wonders what to do next, just pause some or ask the other.  This
imperfection is what makes it more dynamic and exciting, and in almost
all cases the audience has been impressed with the co-teaching
strategy, even if it’s not perfect.</p>
