<p>As a helper, we do not expect you to know all our <a class="reference external" href="https://coderefinery.org/lessons/">CodeRefinery training material</a> but if you have time:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Read through the instructor guides for the lessons (ask instructors if you do
not know where to find them).</p></li>
<li><p>Be ready to introduce yourself in one or two sentences: think about what you
would like to convey as helpers to the classroom. How did (or does)
CodeRefinery help you?</p></li>

<h3>Code of Conduct<a class="headerlink" href="#code-of-conduct" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Teaching isn’t about helping those who are already “in”, it is for those who aren’t.  Thus, we follow <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html">The Carpentries Code of Conduct</a> for all our interactions before, during and after workshops.</p>
<p>If you see anything that is not supporting an equal learning environment,
please mention it to one of instructors.</p>

<div class="section" id="creating-a-positive-learning-environment">
<h3>Creating a positive learning environment<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-positive-learning-environment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As a helper, you have a crucial role during workshops:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Encourage learners to learn from each other.</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledge that some of the material can be difficult and that they will
learn more working together.</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledge when learners are confused and raise it to the instructors.
Understanding why learners are confused provides useful feedback for
instructors. You should be our eyes and ears.</p></li>
<li><p>As we said, you don’t have to know everything, just like learners don’t
necessarily know everything (we don’t know everything, either).  It’s more
important to be responsive and work together.</p></li>
<li><p>Stand up and walk around, try to make rounds by everyone.  If you are
convenient, students will ask.  If you are sitting in the back, student’s
wont.  Students rarely try to get your attention from across the room if you
don’t look ready.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="things-you-should-not-do-in-a-workshop">
<h3>Things you should not do in a workshop<a class="headerlink" href="#things-you-should-not-do-in-a-workshop" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Take over the learner’s keyboard. It is rarely a good idea to type anything
for your learners and it can be demotivating for the learner because it
implies you don’t think they can do it themselves or that you don’t want to
wait for them. It also wastes a valuable opportunity for them to develop muscle
memory and other skills that are essential for independent work.  Instead, try
to have a sticky note pad and pen and write the commands that they should type.</p></li>
<li><p>Criticize certain programs, operating systems, or GUI applications, or
learners who use them. (Excel, Windows, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool. Regardless of its
shortcomings, many of your learners may be using that tool. Convincing
someone to change their practices is much harder when they think you disdain
them.</p></li>
<li><p>Dive into complex or detailed technical discussion with the one or two people
in the audience who have advanced knowledge and may not actually need to be
at the workshop.</p></li>
<li><p>Pretend to know more than you do. People will actually trust you more if you
are frank about the limitations of your knowledge, and will be more likely to
ask questions and seek help.</p></li>
<li><p>Use “just”, “easy”, or other demotivating words. These signal to the learner
that the instructor thinks their problem is trivial and by extension that
they therefore must be stupid for not being able to figure it out.</p></li>
<li><p>Feign surprise at learners not knowing something. Saying things like “I can’t
believe you don’t know X” or “You’ve never heard of Y?” signals to the
learner that they do not have some required pre-knowledge of the material you
are teaching, that they don’t belong at the workshop, and it may prevent them
from asking questions in the future.</p></li>
