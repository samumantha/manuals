<h1>Hints on breakout rooms, teams, and helping<a class="headerlink" href="#hints-on-breakout-rooms-teams-and-helping" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h1>
<p>This page is more targeted to online workshops, but could be relevant
to in-person too.</p>
<p>As an exercise leader, you are what can make a breakout room / group work very
good or just normal.  This is a lot of responsibility and isn’t easy,
but it’s also not that complex: you aren’t expected to know
everything, but instead focus on the flow.  Our guidelines below
should make it doable for everyone.</p>
<p>Here, we give some hints on making the most of breakout rooms.  This
is especially targeted towards exercise leaders/helpers.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>An <strong>exercise leader</strong> has basic knowledge and keeps one breakout room going.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>expert helper/instructor</strong> is someone who knows material well,
possibly an instructor.  They tend to move around helping different
groups.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="background-hierarchical-workshops-to-scale">
<h2>Background: hierarchical workshops to scale<a class="headerlink" href="#background-hierarchical-workshops-to-scale" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Traditionally, a workshops has instructors and exercise leaders/helpers, but the
capacity is limited by instructors, so we are limited to ~30-40 people
at most.  Then, we tried to scale to larger numbers: even up to and beyond 100
people.  For this, we have to rely on <em>exercise leaders</em> a lot more, to run a
breakout room.  An exercise leader does not have to be an expert in the
material, but should be able to keep things flowing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="teams">
<h2>Teams<a class="headerlink" href="#teams" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>We try to arrange people in teams which stay together for all breakout
sessions on all days.  This allows people to form a bond and get the
rooms started sooner.  We will try to keep you in the same breakout
room as long as we can, but we give no promises and will rearrange as
needed when people can’t attend.</p>
<p>We sometimes allow people to register as teams: This could for example be a group colleagues/friends where one of the team members has a bit of knowledge on the tools presented in the workhop. This person can act as exercise leader for the workshop, but may still learn a thing or two themselves. In that way you can work with people you know and the barrier for asking questions and discuss together may be a bit lower than in a group of strangers. Since teams with exercise leaders are ‘self-sustaining’ we usually accept all team registrations, while registrations as single learner may be put on waiting list or, if applicable redirected to the stream, when they exceed our capacity based on the number of individual exercise leaders.</p>

<div class="section" id="in-the-main-session">
<h3>in the main session<a class="headerlink" href="#in-the-main-session" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>As an instructor, when preparing your lesson you first need to decide how to balance between the
main room and breakout sessions.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Clearly say when a learner watches, when they type along, when they should
work on something independently as an exercise.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>CodeRefinery is traditionally a hands-on workshop, so breakout-room sessions should be a large part of the workshop.</p></li>
<li><p>We usually keep the main room mostly for general discussions. Small exercises or polls can also be done in the main room, for all hands-on exercises we divide the learners into breakout-rooms each with one exercise leader.</p></li>
<li><p>To give you an idea about how the work in the breakout rooms is going, monitor the hackmd closely and if time allows try to visit a few breakout rooms to see how it is going and if needed adjust the timing.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="preparing-for-the-breakouts-in-the-main-room">
<h3>Preparing for the breakouts (in the main room)<a class="headerlink" href="#preparing-for-the-breakouts-in-the-main-room" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p><strong>As an instructor, you need to clearly define what the tasks of each
breakout session is (even if it is just “explore and discuss”).</strong>
Online courses need more <strong>“meta talk”</strong> about how you expect things
to go, since it’s not as easy to read the room or fill in expectations
later (distractions, hard to communicate to breakout rooms after
opened).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Clearly say what the tasks of the breakout session will be.</p></li>
<li><p>Put that task and a link to the part of the lesson in the hackmd.</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly say how long each breakout session will be (make sure it’s
long enough and adjust during the exercise session if needed)</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly say if things in the future will depend on this exercise (is
someone completely lost if they don’t make it to the end.  Halfway?)</p></li>
<li><p>Try to make breakout sessions longer:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>imagine a 5 minute overhead for each session, getting people
there, deciding who does what, acquainted with what they need to
do, and debugging problems.</p></li>
<li><p>10 minutes is quite short, 20 minutes is best.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Can you say less and let people discover it for themselves?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As an exercise leader, if anything is unclear to you, it is very unclear to
others. Comment/Ask in the HackMD or speak up and ask!</p>

<span id="breakout-helpers"></span><h2>Exercise leaders in breakout rooms<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-leaders-in-breakout-rooms" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>As an exercise leader in a breakout room, your main task is to <em>keep people talking
and interacting, understand their difficulties, and encourage them to
work on the exercises together.</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You can always start by greeting people and asking how the lesson is
going</p></li>
<li><p>Encourage people to turn on cameras</p></li>
<li><p>You can use chat within breakout rooms: Chat to “Everyone” in a
breakout room only means people in that room.</p></li>
<li><p>There are several strategies below.  Combine as needed - read the
room and see what they want, but do provide encouragement to do
something.</p></li>
<li><p>If you need extra help, write it in the HackMD, someone should be
watching it and relay it to the host. Expert helpers/instructors will try to
visit your rooms periodically, anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>Watch the time and try to keep things moving.  If some debugging
takes to long, it’s reasonable to ask for an expert helper who might
have seen the problem before.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If any one problem takes too long, it’s OK to say “we don’t have
time, let’s come back”</p></li>
<li><p>Or, ask for an expert helper to come by and maybe answer
quickly, or break off to work on a solution.</p></li>
</ul>

questions at the bottom.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this image"></a></p>
</div>
<p>There are several strategies you can use to run your breakout room:</p>
<p>Strategy 1:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Exercise leader asks someone to share the screen and go through the exercise.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>You can encourage the others to guide the one who is sharing the
screen. Or let the person go on her/his own pace.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If no one dares at first, you can also start sharing your screen and let the room tell you what to write.</p></li>
<li><p>That way they see how it can go and the barrier shrinks.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Try to alternate who is sharing the screen for each session.</p></li>
<li><p>When someone has an issue, it is a good idea to switch screen share to them
and maybe even continue from there</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Strategy 2:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Everyone does the exercises themselves, and once someone has a
question, encourage them to share the screen and you discuss.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>If everyone is active, this can be good, but there is a risk that no
one starts off.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Strategy 3:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>You can also share the screen if no one is willing to.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>It might be good to give learners some lead first, and use this only
if no one volunteers.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="common-problems">
<h3>Common problems<a class="headerlink" href="#common-problems" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>One learner asks very many questions, ends up monopolizing all of
the time.  Other learners are left without help, and the whole group
may not get the exercises done</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Call an expert helper to the room.  They should be circulating,
so let them know to spend some more time</p></li>
<li><p>It can be very hard to say “no”, but it’s more important to have
balance than answer every question you are asked.  If you need
to say no, you can try things such as “I’m sorry, but in order
to finish we need to go on now.  We can keep working on it
later - would you like to watch?”</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>There is some sort of problem that ends up taking a lot of time</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Work on it for a minute or two.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask for an expert helper to drop by, by writing in the HackMD.
Nothing wrong with this.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="section" id="expert-helpers">
<span id="experts-breakout-rooms"></span><h2>Expert helpers<a class="headerlink" href="#expert-helpers" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>There’s not much difference between a exercise leader and expert helper, but we
envision this role standing by and jumping into rooms when there’s a
difficult problem.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Sometimes, you wait around for a problem that needs your attention.
But it’s better to be proactive and go into the rooms yourself and
check them out.  Talk to the organizers/instructors to see which you
should do.</p></li>
<li><p>You aren’t assigned to particular breakout room, but <strong>you can
switch between them</strong> (but it’s not obvious how):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To do this, you <em>do</em> get assigned into one room initially.  Join
that room.  <em>After</em> you are in the room, click on “Breakout
Rooms”, and then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Join</span></code> to switch to a different room of your
choice.</p></li>
<li><p>You also always have the option “Leave breakout room” (if in a
room) or “Join your assigned room” (if in main room and assigned
one).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Your role is to switch between breakout rooms and check up on them.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>e.g. join room 1, take a look/ask how it is, then join room 2,
then 3, then back to 1, and repeat.</p></li>
<li><p>Of course, stay in one longer, if it’s needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a note of any important questions to be asked in the main
room afterwards.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Try to divide up the breakout rooms between the staff, and try to
join and catch up with the same rooms (this promotes familiarity).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>E.g. A rotates between rooms 1-3, B gets rooms 4-7, C gets rooms
8-11.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Make sure to watch the HackMD for expert helper requests</strong>, this could help
you decide which room to jump to next.  Comment when you are heading
there.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Concrete example for an expert helper’s time:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I join breakout room 5 randomly.  I spend 15 seconds watching, then
ask if things are going OK.  If everything is good, I move on within
a minute since I am not needed (if there is a good break, I’ll ask
“everything OK?  good, see you around.”).  If there are questions
that I can help with, I answer them.  If they seem to be struggling,
then I will make a note in the HackMD and stay a while longer and
watch/help.</p></li>

<h2>Common issues and solutions<a class="headerlink" href="#common-issues-and-solutions" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A room is very slow, the person sharing the screen is working quite
slowly.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Kindly suggest that you or someone else take over and go through
it faster</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, this is hard to say nicely</p></li>

<li><p>No one wants to take initiative and screen share</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you think everyone is confident enough, this can be OK</p></li>
<li><p>But especially at the beginning of the workshops, you can share
your own screen and go along with people.</p></li>

<li><p>Someone is having trouble installing software</p>
