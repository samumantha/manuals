<p>It’s easy to think “it’s just online, it’s easy to passively watch”.
However, for an interactive workshop you do need to take part to get
the most of out it, and our workshops are targeted to that.  If you
read this page and the workshop prerequisites, you should be OK.</p>

<p>Attend with someone!  Register together and try to be in their same
group.  You could even reserve a room and work together.  This will
create a network of learning and practice that will last much longer.</p>
<p>If you can attend a group, that is even better.  You can bring your
own exercise leader to guide you (if the workshop works this way).  Research
shows that groups that have multiple adopters have much more uptake of
new skills.</p>

<p>Get a good, quiet workspace.  Make sure it is comfortable enough to
stay at for a while.</p>
<p>An extra monitor is useful but not required, since there is a lot of
stuff to follow: the stream itself, the lesson webpage, and the window
where you are doing the assignment.  You could also use a second
device to watch the stream (but if you do, see the
<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-zoom-mechanics"><span class="doc std std-doc">Zoom</span></a> page for info about screen sharing).</p>
<p>You’ll be expected to talk at some times and take part, not simply be
quiet and listen all the time.  Try to be in a place where you can
speak without disturbing others.  By the same token, you’ll be
listening for a long time, and your ears may get tired of headphones.
If you have good enough external speakers, be somewhere that you can
use them (perhaps only sometimes - when it doesn’t interfere with your
microphone.)</p>
<p>If you work in a large office, consider attending from home or in a
meeting room so that you can speak and listen more freely.  If you
need and extra monitor or more comfortable seating space and don’t
have that at home, consider working at your office.  Yes, these are
conflicting ideas, you need to find what works best for you.</p>

<p>Don’t schedule overlapping meetings, reserve the entire timeslots,
minimze distractions.  It’s easy to think you can do multiple things
at once when doing it online, but really it’s a trap.</p>
<p>Join the workshop 10 minutes early to get ready.</p>
<p>There will be breaks, but even long ones go by very fast, and this
gives you limited time to make coffee, eat, etc.  We try to limit
ourselves to half-days because of this, but consider preparing food,
coffee, etc. in advance.</p>

<p>A livestream workshop allow us to reach an unlimited number of people,
at the cost of not being as interactive.  Still, we have solutions:</p>

<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-hackmd-mechanics"><span class="doc">HackMD</span></a> allows you to ask questions anonymously -
even better than a normal workshop!  Once we have a few tens of people in
any workshop, people don’t ask voice questions anyway.</p></li>

interactive assistance during the exercise/breakout sessions.</p></li>

<h4>Creating a positive learning environment<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-positive-learning-environment" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>As an exercise leader, you have a crucial role during workshops:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Encourage learners to learn from each other.</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledge that some of the material can be difficult and that people in your breakoutroom will
learn more working together.</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledge when learners are confused and raise it to the instructors.
Understanding why learners are confused provides useful feedback for
instructors. You are our eyes and ears.</p></li>
<li><p>As we said, you don’t have to know everything, just like learners don’t
necessarily know everything (we don’t know everything, either). It’s more
important to be responsive and work together.</p></li>
<li><p>In an online workshop: Turn on your camera, and encourage everyone else to do so as well. Have an introductory round in the first breakout room session, to get to know your group. Whichever strategy you choose for your breakoutroom (see also <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#breakout-helpers"><span class="std std-ref">Helping in breakoutrooms</span></a>), be present and encourage learners to ask questions.</p></li>
<li><p>In an in-person workshop: Stand up and walk around, try to make rounds by everyone.  If you are
convenient, students will ask.  If you are sitting in the back, student’s
wont.  Students rarely try to get your attention from across the room if you
don’t look ready.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="things-you-should-not-do-in-a-workshop">
<h4>Things you should not do in a workshop<a class="headerlink" href="#things-you-should-not-do-in-a-workshop" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Take over the learner’s keyboard (neither physically nor remotely). It is rarely a good idea to type anything
for your learners and it can be demotivating for the learner because it
implies you don’t think they can do it themselves or that you don’t want to
wait for them. It also wastes a valuable opportunity for them to develop muscle
memory and other skills that are essential for independent work.  Instead, try
to have a sticky note pad and pen / use the zoom chat and write the commands that they should type.</p></li>
<li><p>Criticize certain programs, operating systems, or GUI applications, or
learners who use them. (Excel, Windows, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool. Regardless of its
shortcomings, many of your learners may be using that tool. Convincing
someone to change their practices is much harder when they think you disdain
them.</p></li>
<li><p>Dive into complex or detailed technical discussion with the one or two people
in the audience who have advanced knowledge and may not actually need to be
at the workshop.</p></li>
<li><p>Pretend to know more than you do. People will actually trust you more if you
are frank about the limitations of your knowledge, and will be more likely to
ask questions and seek help.</p></li>
<li><p>Use “just”, “easy”, or other demotivating words. These signal to the learner
that the instructor thinks their problem is trivial and by extension that
they therefore must be stupid for not being able to figure it out.</p></li>
<li><p>Feign surprise at learners not knowing something. Saying things like “I can’t
believe you don’t know X” or “You’ve never heard of Y?” signals to the
learner that they do not have some required pre-knowledge of the material you
are teaching, that they don’t belong at the workshop, and it may prevent them
from asking questions in the future.</p></li>

<h2>Hints on breakout rooms, teams, and helping<a class="headerlink" href="#hints-on-breakout-rooms-teams-and-helping" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This page is more targeted to online workshops, but could be relevant
to in-person too.</p>
<p>As an exercise leader, you are what can make a breakout room / group work very
good or just normal.  This is a lot of responsibility and isn’t easy,
but it’s also not that complex: you aren’t expected to know
everything, but instead focus on the flow.  Our guidelines below
should make it doable for everyone.</p>
<p>Here, we give some hints on making the most of breakout rooms.  This
is especially targeted towards exercise leaders/helpers.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>An <strong>exercise leader</strong> has basic knowledge and keeps one breakout room going.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>expert helper/instructor</strong> is someone who knows material well,
possibly an instructor.  They tend to move around helping different
groups.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="background-hierarchical-workshops-to-scale">
<h3>Background: hierarchical workshops to scale<a class="headerlink" href="#background-hierarchical-workshops-to-scale" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Traditionally, a workshops has instructors and exercise leaders/helpers, but the
capacity is limited by instructors, so we are limited to ~30-40 people
at most.  Then, we tried to scale to larger numbers: even up to and beyond 100
people.  For this, we have to rely on <em>exercise leaders</em> a lot more, to run a
breakout room.  An exercise leader does not have to be an expert in the
material, but should be able to keep things flowing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="teams">
<h3>Teams<a class="headerlink" href="#teams" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>We try to arrange people in teams which stay together for all breakout
sessions on all days.  This allows people to form a bond and get the
rooms started sooner.  We will try to keep you in the same breakout
room as long as we can, but we give no promises and will rearrange as
needed when people can’t attend.</p>
<p>We sometimes allow people to register as teams: This could for example be a group colleagues/friends where one of the team members has a bit of knowledge on the tools presented in the workhop. This person can act as exercise leader for the workshop, but may still learn a thing or two themselves. In that way you can work with people you know and the barrier for asking questions and discuss together may be a bit lower than in a group of strangers. Since teams with exercise leaders are ‘self-sustaining’ we usually accept all team registrations, while registrations as single learner may be put on waiting list or, if applicable redirected to the stream, when they exceed our capacity based on the number of individual exercise leaders.</p>

<h4>in the main session<a class="headerlink" href="#in-the-main-session" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>As an instructor, when preparing your lesson you first need to decide how to balance between the
main room and breakout sessions.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Clearly say when a learner watches, when they type along, when they should
work on something independently as an exercise.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>CodeRefinery is traditionally a hands-on workshop, so breakout-room sessions should be a large part of the workshop.</p></li>
<li><p>We usually keep the main room mostly for general discussions. Small exercises or polls can also be done in the main room, for all hands-on exercises we divide the learners into breakout-rooms each with one exercise leader.</p></li>
<li><p>To give you an idea about how the work in the breakout rooms is going, monitor the hackmd closely and if time allows try to visit a few breakout rooms to see how it is going and if needed adjust the timing.</p></li>

<h4>Preparing for the breakouts (in the main room)<a class="headerlink" href="#preparing-for-the-breakouts-in-the-main-room" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p><strong>As an instructor, you need to clearly define what the tasks of each
breakout session is (even if it is just “explore and discuss”).</strong>
Online courses need more <strong>“meta talk”</strong> about how you expect things
to go, since it’s not as easy to read the room or fill in expectations
later (distractions, hard to communicate to breakout rooms after
opened).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Clearly say what the tasks of the breakout session will be.</p></li>
<li><p>Put that task and a link to the part of the lesson in the hackmd.</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly say how long each breakout session will be (make sure it’s
long enough and adjust during the exercise session if needed)</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly say if things in the future will depend on this exercise (is
someone completely lost if they don’t make it to the end.  Halfway?)</p></li>
<li><p>Try to make breakout sessions longer:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>imagine a 5 minute overhead for each session, getting people
there, deciding who does what, acquainted with what they need to
do, and debugging problems.</p></li>
<li><p>10 minutes is quite short, 20 minutes is best.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Can you say less and let people discover it for themselves?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As an exercise leader, if anything is unclear to you, it is very unclear to
others. Comment/Ask in the HackMD or speak up and ask!</p>

<p>As an exercise leader in a breakout room, your main task is to <em>keep people talking
and interacting, understand their difficulties, and encourage them to
work on the exercises together.</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You can always start by greeting people and asking how the lesson is
going</p></li>
<li><p>Encourage people to turn on cameras</p></li>
<li><p>You can use chat within breakout rooms: Chat to “Everyone” in a
breakout room only means people in that room.</p></li>
<li><p>There are several strategies below.  Combine as needed - read the
room and see what they want, but do provide encouragement to do
something.</p></li>
<li><p>If you need extra help, write it in the HackMD, someone should be
watching it and relay it to the host. Expert helpers/instructors will try to
visit your rooms periodically, anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>Watch the time and try to keep things moving.  If some debugging
takes to long, it’s reasonable to ask for an expert helper who might
have seen the problem before.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If any one problem takes too long, it’s OK to say “we don’t have
time, let’s come back”</p></li>
<li><p>Or, ask for an expert helper to come by and maybe answer
quickly, or break off to work on a solution.</p></li>

<p>There are several strategies you can use to run your breakout room:</p>
<p>Strategy 1:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Exercise leader asks someone to share the screen and go through the exercise.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>You can encourage the others to guide the one who is sharing the
screen. Or let the person go on her/his own pace.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If no one dares at first, you can also start sharing your screen and let the room tell you what to write.</p></li>
<li><p>That way they see how it can go and the barrier shrinks.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Try to alternate who is sharing the screen for each session.</p></li>
<li><p>When someone has an issue, it is a good idea to switch screen share to them
and maybe even continue from there</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Strategy 2:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Everyone does the exercises themselves, and once someone has a
question, encourage them to share the screen and you discuss.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>If everyone is active, this can be good, but there is a risk that no
one starts off.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Strategy 3:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>You can also share the screen if no one is willing to.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>It might be good to give learners some lead first, and use this only
if no one volunteers.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="common-problems">
<h4>Common problems<a class="headerlink" href="#common-problems" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>One learner asks very many questions, ends up monopolizing all of
the time.  Other learners are left without help, and the whole group
may not get the exercises done</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Call an expert helper to the room.  They should be circulating,
so let them know to spend some more time</p></li>
<li><p>It can be very hard to say “no”, but it’s more important to have
balance than answer every question you are asked.  If you need
to say no, you can try things such as “I’m sorry, but in order
to finish we need to go on now.  We can keep working on it
later - would you like to watch?”</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>There is some sort of problem that ends up taking a lot of time</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Work on it for a minute or two.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask for an expert helper to drop by, by writing in the HackMD.
Nothing wrong with this.</p></li>

<span id="experts-breakout-rooms"></span><h3>Expert helpers<a class="headerlink" href="#expert-helpers" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>There’s not much difference between a exercise leader and expert helper, but we
envision this role standing by and jumping into rooms when there’s a
difficult problem.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Sometimes, you wait around for a problem that needs your attention.
But it’s better to be proactive and go into the rooms yourself and
check them out.  Talk to the organizers/instructors to see which you
should do.</p></li>
<li><p>You aren’t assigned to particular breakout room, but <strong>you can
switch between them</strong> (but it’s not obvious how):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To do this, you <em>do</em> get assigned into one room initially.  Join
that room.  <em>After</em> you are in the room, click on “Breakout
Rooms”, and then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Join</span></code> to switch to a different room of your
choice.</p></li>
<li><p>You also always have the option “Leave breakout room” (if in a
room) or “Join your assigned room” (if in main room and assigned
one).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Your role is to switch between breakout rooms and check up on them.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>e.g. join room 1, take a look/ask how it is, then join room 2,
then 3, then back to 1, and repeat.</p></li>
<li><p>Of course, stay in one longer, if it’s needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a note of any important questions to be asked in the main
room afterwards.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Try to divide up the breakout rooms between the staff, and try to
join and catch up with the same rooms (this promotes familiarity).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>E.g. A rotates between rooms 1-3, B gets rooms 4-7, C gets rooms
8-11.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Make sure to watch the HackMD for expert helper requests</strong>, this could help
you decide which room to jump to next.  Comment when you are heading
there.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Concrete example for an expert helper’s time:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I join breakout room 5 randomly.  I spend 15 seconds watching, then
ask if things are going OK.  If everything is good, I move on within
a minute since I am not needed (if there is a good break, I’ll ask
“everything OK?  good, see you around.”).  If there are questions
that I can help with, I answer them.  If they seem to be struggling,
then I will make a note in the HackMD and stay a while longer and
watch/help.</p></li>

<h3>From exercise leader/helper to more<a class="headerlink" href="#from-exercise-leader-helper-to-more" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Here is one possible pathway from learner to (whatever else).  This is
an <em>idea</em> for a pathway but by no means a requirement - you can join
at whatever step you like, and steps don’t have to happen in order.
Maybe you are interested in some or the other.  There are also roles
completely outside of this pathway.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>After being a learner, you come back as an exercise leader/helper.</p></li>
<li><p>When you have a solid understanding of all materials, you may join
as an expert helper.</p></li>
<li><p>You begin co-teaching episodes with someone else</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We find that co-teaching is a good way to start.  In this, there
are two people, one person assumes the big-picture discussion, and
the other the typing and explaining what they are doing.  By
making the lesson a discussion instead of a lecture, it’s more
dynamic.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Eventually, you get confident enough to teach yourself (though
really we should always be co-teaching…)</p></li>
<li><p>Somewhere in there (before or after instructor, depending on your
interests), you may want to try to be a HackMD helper or Zoom host.
These are more about coordinating all the other people involved in
the workshop.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s emphasize again: this is one pathway, but you should do what you
want.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="as-an-instructor">
<h3>As an instructor<a class="headerlink" href="#as-an-instructor" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Most of our workshops are very collaborative arrangements: you are
rarely alone.  This is one way of looking at it:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Look at and revise the workshops before they teach, making small,
incremental improvements.  But, you don’t have to (and in some
sense, it’s good if they stabilize some more).</p></li>
<li><p>Especially go over the examples when preparing.</p></li>
<li><p>Have a chat with someone else (probably another instructor or
expert helper) before teaching.  We encourage this for
everyone, even experienced instructors, to better transfer knowledge
among each other and stay up to date with the latest developments.</p></li>
<li><p>Teach independently or co-teach.  Ideally, co-teach the first
time(s).  Really, we’d like to get to the point where we <em>always</em>
co-teach.  Co-teaching doesn’t mean different people take different
lessons, but two people teach all parts of the same lesson by
turning it into a discussion between the two instructors.  TODO:
produce information on this.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="top-issues-new-instructors-face">
<h3>Top issues new instructors face<a class="headerlink" href="#top-issues-new-instructors-face" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Breaks are not negotiable, minimum 10 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Breakout sessions too short.  Make them as long as possible, don’t
expect to come back for new intro, then go back.</p></li>
<li><p>People will accomplish less than you expect.  Expect learners to be 5
times slower than you, at best!</p></li>
<li><p>All the other tools and stuff will go wrong.  Try to not bring in a
dependency when you don’t need it.</p></li>
<li><p>Trying to accomplish too much: it’s OK to cut out and adapt to the
audience.  Have a reserve session at the end you prepare, but are
ready to skip.</p></li>
<li><p>Explaining how, but not why.</p></li>
<li><p>Running out of time to making your environment match the
learner’s.</p></li>
<li><p>Running out of time to set up good screen sharing practices
(terminal history, portion of screen, remote history) in advance.</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming learners remember what they have already learned, or know
the prerequisites.  Or have stuff installed and configured.</p></li>
<li><p>Not managing expectations: learners think that you will accomplish
everything, and feel sad when you don’t.</p></li>

</ul>
<p>Update with meta-talk, so that learners can follow along easily:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Add Icebreaker and introductory material of the day.  Try to talk to
people as they joined to get them to open HackMD and answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Anything important for following along should not be only said via
voice.  It needs to be in the HackMD, too.</p></li>
<li><p>New lessons or episodes, with links to them.</p></li>
<li><p>For exercises, link to exercise and add the duration, end time,
goals.  If these are unclear, bring it up to the instructor by voice.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a status display about breaks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Screenshare it when necessary:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>During breaks and other times, share the HackMD (including the
notification about break, and when it ends).</p></li>
<li><p>It is nice if the arrangement allows some of the latest questions to
be seen, so people are reminded to ask there.</p></li>
<li><p>Someone else may do this, but should make sure it happens.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Answer questions</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If there is an question that should be answered by the instructor by
voice, bring it up (by voice) to the instructor immediately.</p></li>
<li><p>During breakout sessions, watch for HackMD notifications about
breakout rooms that need help
and direct someone to that room.</p></li>
<li><p>How soon do you answer questions? Two points of view:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Answer questions right away: can be really intense to follow.</p></li>
<li><p>Wait some so that we don’t overload learners: reduces the info
flow.  But then do people need to check back more often.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to find your own balance.  Maybe a quick answer right
away, and more detailed later.  Or delay answers during the most
important parts of the lecture.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Be careful that you don’t give too long and involved answers, which
take up too much mental energy from learners while they are
learning.  It’s a balance you should think about on your own.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Here, it is useful to have multiple short followups in bullet
points, each going a bit more in detail.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ensure it can be posted quickly:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>HackMD gets posted to the workshop webpage.  For this, it needs some
minimal amount of formatting (it doesn’t need to be perfect, just
not horrible).</p></li>
<li><p>All names and private information needs to be stripped.  This is why
you should rigorously tag all names with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[name=XXX]</span></code> so they can be
removed (see above).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Learner names can be completely removed.  CR staff names can be
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[name=CR]</span></code> or something similar.</p></li>
<li><p>There may be other private URLs at the top or bottom.</p></li>

<h2>Teaching via livestreaming<a class="headerlink" href="#teaching-via-livestreaming" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>We’ve all done a lot of teaching via Zoom, but the CodeRefinery

idea (and for a detailed reference, see <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-coderefinery-mooc"><span class="doc">CodeRefinery MOOC strategy</span></a>).</p>
<p>Compared to Zoom teaching:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You are in a Zoom meeting with only instructors/staff</p></li>
<li><p>Someone (not you) captures this meeting and broadcasts it via
livestream to all the audience.</p></li>
<li><p>The audience can’t directly talk with you (but when there is a large
audience, who does anyway).  Instead, always say things like “What
do you think?  Write in the HackMD. [proceed to screenshare it and
discuss answers]”</p></li>
<li><p>You don’t need to worry much about managing the audience.  Others do
this and relay information as you need.</p></li>
<li><p>You should pay attention to the HackMD more.  This doesn’t mean all
the time (co-teachers can do it while you are actively teaching),
but it should always be kept close.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="basic-meeting-setup">
<h3>Basic meeting setup<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-meeting-setup" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>

<li><p>During the breaks/exercise times, the livestream itself (via OBS)
gets <em>muted</em> and <em>switched to another scene</em>.  So, you are free to
unmute, talk, and chat with other instructors.  This is a great way
to relax and prepare for the next segments!</p></li>

<div class="section" id="screensharing">
<h3>Screensharing<a class="headerlink" href="#screensharing" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>You can share your screen normally via Zoom.  The livestream is fixed
to an aspect ratio of 840 pixels wide × 1080 pixels high (this is so
that the learner has half of their screen available).  <strong>You can not
do a full landscape screenshare (nor is this good in other
workshops).</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In <strong>Zoom</strong>, you can either share one window or Advanced → Share a
portion of the screen → move the overlay to a landscape view.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a landscape presentation, just share your whole screen,

<div class="section" id="hackmd-and-audience-feedback">
<h3>HackMD and audience feedback<a class="headerlink" href="#hackmd-and-audience-feedback" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>HackMD (or similar document-based things) is our preferred
communication system.  The biggest problem is that it is <em>too</em> useful,
and too many people ask questions, which will easily overload you.  To
solve this, we have co-teachers (non-typer can watch HackMD), HackMD
helpers (watch and answer basic questions).</p>
<p>There are several general strategies:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Occasionally screenshare the HackMD.  This emphasizes to the
audience that questions there <em>do</em> get noticed.</p></li>
<li><p>During Q&amp;A time, go to the HackMD and comment on the most important
questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Call on co-teachers, “do we have any good questions from HackMD?”</p></li>
<li><p>Co-teachers should be more than willing to bring up relevant
questions right away.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can’t use Zoom polls and so on.  Instead, use HackMD cleverly.
For example, below you see a poll (people add <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">o</span></code> to make a bar
graph), and a free response.</p>

<h2>Team teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#team-teaching" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Listening to only one person talk can be boring.  Listening to a discussion is
much less so.  “Team teaching” can mean many things, but in this case we
are referring to <strong>two instructors are both actively
involved in lecturing at the same time</strong>, as some sort of conversation
between them.  It is a form of co-teaching.</p>
<p>When it works well, it makes a lecture much more dynamic and
engaging, and reduces the load for each person to plan everything
because you can rely on two minds to do it live.
The difficulty is that it’s our nature to keep talking while teaching,
making a conversation difficult.</p>
<div class="section" id="basics">
<h3>Basics<a class="headerlink" href="#basics" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>We can’t claim to know the best way to do this yet, but we have seen ways
that work and don’t work.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that you want to keep a constant <em>conversation</em>
going.  This can be a mutual discussion, one person explaining big
concepts and one the details, one person asking
questions and the other answering, or some other combination.</p>
<p>There is less need for the instructors to prepare every single thing,
since you can rely
on the wisdom of the group to get you through areas you haven’t
perfectly prepared.  In fact, this is good, because then your learners will
see things go slightly wrong and your live debugging.
Still it can be useful to agree with your co-instructor on the choreography
of your session (more about this below).</p>
<p>We propose two basic models, but of course there is a constant
continuum.
And in either model it can be good to switch roles every 20-30 minutes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="model-1-guide-and-demo-giver">
<h3>Model 1: Guide and demo-giver<a class="headerlink" href="#model-1-guide-and-demo-giver" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>One person serves the role of <strong>guide</strong>, explaining the big picture
and possibly even the examples.  The <strong>demo-giver</strong> shows the typing
and does the examples, and could take the role of a learner who is
asking about what is going on, the person who actually explains the
details, or an occasional commenter.  Anyway, the guide is the one
navigating through the course and bringing up material in a logical
order for the audience.</p>
<p>Hands-on demos and exercises work especially well like this.  Here,
the guide would follow the outline and serve as the director (see
below).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="model-2-presenter-and-interviewer">
<h3>Model 2: Presenter and interviewer<a class="headerlink" href="#model-2-presenter-and-interviewer" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>In this case, it is the <strong>presenter</strong> who is mostly explaining <em>and</em>
giving the demos, and generally trying to move the forward through the
material.  The <strong>interviewer</strong> serves as a learner or spotter, fills
in gaps by asking relevant questions, and tries to comment to the
presenter when things are going off track.</p>
<p>This is closer to normal teaching, so feels more natural to do.  The
big disadvantage is that it’s the tendency of the presenter to keep
talking, and the tendency of the interviewer to be nice and not
interrupt.  This negates most of the benefit you would hope to have,
but is much better than solo teaching.</p>
<p>Here, the presenter would follow the outline and serve as the
director (see below).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hints">
<h3>Hints<a class="headerlink" href="#hints" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>With more than one person, there is a risk of seeming uncoordinated
when the team doesn’t know who is supposed to move the lesson forward.
It’s not bad to have short discussions to decide what to do next, it
makes the show seem interactive.  But if it happens too
much, it becomes noticeable.  You could adopt a principle which exists
in many domains: at any time, only one person is
in control.  Implemented in team teaching, it becomes: <em>you explicitly
know who is in control</em> (the <strong>director</strong>).  <em>The director is
responsible for understanding the current situation and checking with other
instructors, but in when you just need to something and no one has
strong opinions, you don’t debate, the director decides.</em>  The main
difference of Model 1 and Model 2 above is “is the director the one
mainly explaining new material, or the one asking questions”.</p>
<p>We can’t tell you what works best for you.  But the models above and
thinking about who the director is should let you have an efficient
discussion to decide your model.  The need for a director is why we
don’t recommend fully equal co-teachers.  Instead, divide the course
into parts and use the two models for each part.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Of course, there are other roles in a workshop.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>HackMD watcher</strong> pays particular attention to the audience
questions.  They can interrupt anytime.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Meeting host</strong> manages the meeting itself (note this is
different from the “host” role above).</p></li>
<li><p>The Director could be completely separate from the people on
screen, and somehow sending signals to the teachers as needed.
But, unlike scripted media, the course reacts more to the audience
and it is better for the director to be in the lecture.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If you ever go off-plan, that’s OK.  You can discuss during the
lecture so the audience can know what you are doing and why.  You
<em>want</em> to adjust to the audience more than you would in a solo
course.  But at the same time, be wary of deviating too much from
the material that the watchers have, since it will be disorienting.</p></li>
<li><p>Two people works well.  With three, it’s hard to allow everyone to
speak equally and people tend to jump on top of each other in the
gaps - or no one talks, to give others a chance to say something.
You could have particular segments where different pairs of
people adopt the main roles, and others speak up if they want.</p></li>
<li><p>Of course, it helps to have a good plan of what you are going to
do.  But if only one person knows that plan, this strategy can still
work, especially if that person is the presenter in model 2.</p></li>
<li><p>The less preparation you have, the more useful it is to strictly
define the roles of each person (to ensure someone is in charge of
moving it forward).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please send us more suggestions to add to this list.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preparation">
<h3>Preparation<a class="headerlink" href="#preparation" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This is one proposed model for preparing for team teaching:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Talk with your co-teacher.  These hints assume a two-person team.</p></li>
<li><p>Decide what material will be covered, overall timing, strategy, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Divide up the material.  In each section, decide the model to use
and roles.</p></li>
<li><p>Decide who will be the director for each part.  Perhaps a good idea
is to keep it consistent: the host is always the director.</p></li>
<li><p>At least one person prepares the outline (the order of topics to be
presented, key questions to ask, etc.).  The guide or presenter
should be comfortable with it (and could even do it mostly alone),
everyone can give comments and make sure to read it at least once.</p></li>
<li><p>Run as above.</p></li>
<li><p>you don’t need to plan every step in detail but it can be useful to prepare
the session together and step through the choreography (e.g. “now I will show
this and then give you the screen and then ask you to do this … you will
lead this 20 minute block and then I will lead that 20 minute block and
please ask me questions while I present X”).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then, just go!  Don’t worry if it’s not perfect, if either person
wonders what to do next, just pause some or ask the other.  This
imperfection is what makes it more dynamic and exciting, and in almost
all cases the audience has been impressed with the co-teaching
strategy, even if it’s not perfect.</p>

<h4>Terminal history for learners<a class="headerlink" href="#terminal-history-for-learners" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>If you are doing live shell work, you will have commands and output
all interleaved, which makes it hard to follow what you actually
typed.  Have a separate window that shows recent commands only,
without output.  Arrange your screen so there is the main window and
the smaller “history” window.  The history window runs the tail
commands and can be used as a reference for what you just did.</p>
<p>Also check the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Sabryr/Teaching-aids">shell exporter by
sabryr</a>, which copies recent
history to a remote server.</p>
<p><strong>Simple</strong>: The simple way is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PROMPT_COMMAND=&quot;history</span> <span class="pre">-a&quot;</span></code> and then
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tail</span> <span class="pre">-f</span> <span class="pre">-n0</span> <span class="pre">~/.bash_history</span></code>, but this doesn’t capture ssh,
subshells, and only shows the command after it is completed.</p>
<p><strong>Better yet still simple</strong>: Many Software Carpentry instructors use
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rgaiacs/swc-shell-split-window">this script</a>,
which sets the prompt, splits the terminal window using tmux and displays command history
in the upper panel. Requirement: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a></p>
<p><strong>Better (bash)</strong>: This prints the output before the command is run,
instead of after.  Tail with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tail</span> <span class="pre">-f</span> <span class="pre">~/demos.out</span></code>.</p>

<h3>Screen sharing<a class="headerlink" href="#screen-sharing" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>You have to assume the smallest screen from learners and plan for that.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Learners have a small screen, and need room for their own terminals
and web browser open, too.  A big screen or multiple monitors is
special.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure the text is more than large enough - people are not just
reading, but struggling to find the important parts while the.</p></li>
<li><p>Sharing a 1920x1080 screen is not a good idea: you need to make all
the text size large so that learners can scale it down, but pixels
are wasted.</p></li>
<li><p>Sharing a single window would be good, but usually you need more
than one.</p></li>
<li><p>Zoom now has a “share portion of screen” (Screen sharing → Advanced
→ Share a portion of the screen).</p></li>
<li><p>Our latest idea is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Share a vertical part of the screen, for example half of your
screen.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a FullHD 1920x1080 screen, maybe even a smaller
portion than that.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When streaming/recording: <strong>Never stop sharing a screen, ask someone
else to take it over</strong>.
There is a chance that the view goes to “gallery view” in the
recording or stream, which makes video editing harder or disrupts
learner privacy.</p>

teaching, it’s not all intuition.  Many citations are included.</p>
<p>This page contains a summary of the most important points.  The point
is that one can quickly refer to this before writing a new lesson or
teaching a course.  The article <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006915">Ten quick tips for creating an

<h2>Online teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#online-teaching" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>In 2020, we were forced to start teaching online.  Is this good or
bad?</p>
<p>The promise of the Internet was that we could reach everyone in the
world.  Instead, we immediately learned to hide or Zoom links from
anyone except the people who register in advance to hide from trolls.
We directly translate in-person to online, and wonder why we don’t
have as much engagement.  It doesn’t have to be this way.
CodeRefinery has developed a vision of this teaching that can take the
best of both worlds.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-different-about-online">
<h3>What is different about online?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-different-about-online" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Online teaching requires a certain mindset.</p>
<p>First off, it is <em>different</em>, and different is not better or worse.
You must rethink your existing assumptions and design for the current world.</p>
<p>Some differences in mindset include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If the material is online, why pay attention <em>now</em>.  Why not find
the same or similar material when you need it?  If the course isn’t
online, still you realize you can do a web search and find something
equivalent later.</p></li>
<li><p>Why <em>dedicate</em> myself to this now?  Why night attend a course
passively now, get the basics, and come back later when I need to
really understand something?</p></li>
<li><p>How to best use the tools?  I might have only one screen to take the
course (and no projector to watch), but the instructor material is
also closer.  Why type things myself, if my normal work is copying
from StackOverflow anyway?</p></li>
<li><p>Related to the above, you can’t use attendance as a proxy for
engagement.  You have to actually engage people, or accept that
passive attendees are OK.  Do you measure the benefit of people
watching the course later?</p></li>
<li><p>Everyone knows how to way of attending in-person courses.  But there
are different ways to attend online courses, and you don’t get as
much feedback from others.  You need to be <em>explicit</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you learn to take advantage of online formats, you might never go
back!</p>

<div class="section" id="taxonomy-of-online-teaching">
<h3>Taxonomy of online teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#taxonomy-of-online-teaching" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This isn’t a strict division, but here is a rough vision of steps to
take, from simplest to more advanced.</p>
<div class="section" id="by-yourself-in-a-meeting">
<h4>(1) By yourself, in a meeting<a class="headerlink" href="#by-yourself-in-a-meeting" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>It’s you and a group of students in a meeting (e.g. Zoom).  This can
reach people, but it’s easy to lose the attention of attendees.
Because you need to avoid trolls and protect privacy, you may have a
private registration and you may not publish recordings.  This gives
limited usefulness in the future.</p>
<p>Key aspects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Set up a good screen share (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{doc}/instructor-tech-online</span></code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Be explicit on how to attend.  Plan for not only attention during
the course but something that has a lasting usefulness.</p></li>
<li><p>Possibly use HackMD for discussions/questions
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{doc}/hackmd-mechanics</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{doc}/hackmd-helper</span></code>, need new info)</p></li>

<h4>(2a) Group teaching, in a meeting<a class="headerlink" href="#a-group-teaching-in-a-meeting" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>One of the advantages of online teaching is it doesn’t require
full-time physical attendance, so you can more easily bring in a
diverse set of helpers, which greatly reduces your load.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Definitely use HackMD instead of chat (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{doc}/hackmd-mechanics</span></code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Separate roles more, so that the instructor only needs to focus on
teaching.  Other helpers can come and go or attend part-time.

<li><p>Expert helpers, helping students</p></li>
<li><p>Zoom host</p></li>
<li><p>HackMD watcher</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, you can start grouping learners together into small
groups.  This is the equivalent of different tables in a physical
workshop.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Zoom breakout rooms can group people together</p></li>
<li><p>You need to be explicit about how the groups work.  Even in person,
many learners work independently even when forced into a group.</p></li>
<li><p>Add “Exercise leaders” (helpers, former students) to guide each
group.</p></li>

<p>Now we reach the real promise of online teaching: by using streaming
platforms, you can reach everyone in the world.  No registration is
needed and anyone can take part.  The disadvantage is that you don’t
have close interaction with the learners (by design: removing these
close interactions how you can accept everyone).</p>

<h2>Open Broadcaster Software<a class="headerlink" href="#open-broadcaster-software" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Open Broadcaster Software is an amazing open-source audio/video
production tool.  It’s probably not professional grade, but is used in
serious events and will make a non-professional feel professional.
The main point is that, instead of being limited to what your meeting
software can do, you can:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>create more advanced mixes of screens/video/etc, without having to
do post-processing.</p></li>

Lately, it is popularized by livestreaming games and other

and decode sound or video.  There are many different codecs,
with different properties of
compression, CPU usage, etc.  The codec is independent of the
program actually used to encode/decode, and also (somewhat, not
entirely) independent of the container format.</p>
</dd>
<dt>container format</dt><dd><p>File format that contains the audio/video data.  There are
different formats, and the container format is independent of
the codec of the material inside (but not all codecs work in all
containers).  There are containers for both streaming and
recorded media.</p>
</dd>
<dt>encoder</dt><dd><p>The program that compresses raw video to the codec for
distribution.  Of course, there are also decoders.  You need the
right decoder for each codec, but most things you would use
these days are widespread.</p>
</dd>
<dt>bitrate</dt><dd><p>Amount of data of the media stream over time.  Usually measured in
Megabits (not bytes, also note the actual unit is
Megabit/second).  As an example,
Netflix on mainstream “high” quality is about 5 Mbit, and Twitch
recommends ~6 Mbit at most.  Netflix on low quality is about .7
Mbit, but of course all these are for movies, not relatively
static screenshares.</p>
<p>The more movement in a scene, the more bitrate required to
encode that at a constant quality.</p>
</dd>
<dt>constant bitrate (CBR)</dt><dd><p>Encoding method where the bitrate does not vary over time.
There is only a small encoding buffer to handle times with a
large amount of movement.</p>
<p>Twitch and other live streaming sites recommend CBR because of
the way the Internet works.  With a live stream, a constant
stream of data is needed.  Internet congestion
control protocols can keep a constant stream going when the
stream is constant.  If
there is a sudden increase in instantaneous bitrate (with VBR
and a section with lots of movement), congestion control
not be able to keep up and buffers empty, causing lag.</p>
<p>Similar considerations apply to other playback modes, such as
embedded devices with limited CPU power, thus the idea of
encoding “targets” (profiles optimized for certain classes of
devices).  Mainstream personal computers tend to have enough
power to decode anything, so this isn’t a major consideration.</p>
</dd>
<dt>variable bitrate (VBR)</dt><dd><p>Encoding method where instantaneous bitrate varies depending on
how much information is needed at each instantaneous point of
time, to encode the complexity of the current scene.  In x264,
this is usually done as “CRF”.</p>
</dd>
<dt>latency</dt><dd><p>Time delay between two events.  In a livestream, time delay
between the performer’s actions and the audience seeing it.
This is caused by countless buffers: encoding buffer, network
buffers, network transmission time, decoding buffer, etc.  Lower
latency increases performance demands on the hardware and
network, so you need to strike a balance.</p>
<p>On Twitch, “low latency mode” gives you 10-15 seconds of latency.</p>

<dt>Sources</dt><dd><p>An image source which can be composed together in a scene.  Scenes

comprehensive set of positional and image effect transforms you can
make.</p>
<p>Sources can have <strong>filters</strong> applied to them, which do some sort of
video transformation (for example, background removal).  There are
also <strong>transformations</strong>, which affect the position in the scene.
Put together, you can do almost anything you would like.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Audio sources</dt><dd><p>You can take audio input from various sources: mainly, microphones

<h3>Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Here, we will go over the main parts of configuration.  We won’t say
everything, since this is graphical program and you can mostly click
around and find your own customization you would like.</p>
<p>Because of the popularity of streaming, it is easy to find more
tutorials and recommendations for anything here.  Add “streaming” or
“OBS” to your search.</p>
<div class="section" id="basic-configuration">
<h4>Basic configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>These options are found in the “Settings” dialog.  These are just

<dt>File → Settings → Stream</dt><dd><p>Here, you would configure the streaming service, if any.</p>
</dd>
<dt>File → Settings → Output</dt><dd><p>Here, you configure streaming/recording output parameters.</p>
<p>If you use <strong>Simple</strong>, you pretty much can’t go wrong.  If you are
mainly screensharing and don’t have much action video, you can
make the bitrate much lower, for example 2500 Kbps.  The slower
“encoder preset” is, the more CPU power that will be spent to get
that quality, so the less space it will use.  The better your CPU
is, the slower you can make it; “fast” to “slow” are reasonable.</p>
<p>If you use <strong>advanced</strong> you have more options:</p>
<p>Streaming: Rate control=CBR, 2500 Kbps, other options don’t matter
so much, defaults should be fine.  You can search for
recommendations online, but realize that most others stream
high-action games so their settings are much higher than you need.</p>
<p>Recording: Recording format, mp4 (mkv would be better, but we need
to check that it can be uploaded to common sites). Encoder=x264,
Rate control=CRF, CRF=22, Keyframe interval=auto, CPU
preset=medium (or slower, for better CPUs)
(slower=use more CPU to do better
encoding, either higher quality or lower bitrate.  Veryfast–Slow
is a good range),
Profile=main, Tune=None</p>
</dd>
<dt>File → Settings → Video</dt><dd><p>Here, you set the base size of the picture you will be using.
You could do FullHD at 1920x1080, or HD at 1280x720.  For vertical
recording, we recommend you do 840x1080.  Use your chosen value
for both Base and Output resolutions.  30 FPS.</p>
<p>When setting your video size, traditionally people tell you to be
as large as possible (to attract viewers).  However, this guide is
focused on teaching
and learning, and for that a) we want our content to be as
accessible as possible.  There is no need for as many pixels as
possible, as we often say “present from your smallest screen”, and
you can do that by artificially restricting yourself.  b) We have
found a vertical screen works well: a learner can have the
video/stream taking up half of their screen, and the other half
available for doing their own work.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="scene-configuration">
<h4>Scene configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#scene-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>After the above, you can set up scenes basically however you would
like.  However, as a starting point I propose these scenes to get you
started (and I propose we standardize on these names, so that we
can make some uniform scripting tools):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Title</strong>, the logos and titles of the event.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gallery</strong>, a gallery of the people presenting (or the one).  When
presenting from a Zoom meeting, this is a capture of the gallery
view in dual-monitor mode.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Local</strong> is a local screenshare, that you get by capturing your own
screen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Remote</strong> is a screenshare by someone remote.  If you are capturing
from a Zoom meeting, it is the capture of the second window of the
dual-monitor mode.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Notes</strong> is some HackMD or other material you might want to show
during discussion periods or breaks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Common types of sources (scene elements) include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Static image (e.g. logo or background)</p></li>
<li><p>Desktop capture, for your local desktop.  You can crop it (in the
source config) to share only a portion of your desktop.</p></li>
<li><p>Single-window capture.  Note that this is smarter than Zoom,
since it can capture the full window even if is not on top.</p></li>
<li><p>Text (which works, but is not very powerful)</p></li>
<li><p>Solid colors</p></li>
<li><p>Other scenes.  You can make one scene, then insert it into other
scenes to avoid duplication of scene elements scene elements.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The sources themselves can be moved around graphically, which is good for
setting things up.  When there are more demanding needs, the source
transformation can be edited for more precise control (right click on
source in preview → edit transformation).  There are
source <em>filters</em>, which can do video effects such as removing a color.
Some sources can be cropped in the source-specific config as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="audio-configuration">
<h4>Audio configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#audio-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>Audio configuration is simpler than video configuration, since there
are fewer different sources.  On the other hand, it is harder to
see what is going on (no preview) so it is harder to adjust it
perfectly, and easier to cause problems like loops.</p>
<p>The main concept is that your computer may have different input and
output sound devices (“cards”).  For example, I can output sound from
some application on my monitor’s speakers, while sound from other
applications on the headphones at the same time.  Find your computer’s
way to see and configure what is going on under the hood.</p>
<p>There are two types of audio inputs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Microphones</strong>, obviously recording from a microphone.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Monitors</strong> (as in, monitor a sound card), recording what is
currently being played on another
sound card.  This is what is used to capture audio from a remote
meeting, such as Zoom.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You set the active audio input in the application settings.  The
volumes of these can be independently adjusted - you want typical
volume to be in the yellow zone.  Advice for various operating systems
include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Linux using PulseAudio: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pavucontrol</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>Windows: ???</p></li>
<li><p>MacOS: ???</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Under “advanced audio properties” (a menu item, also available from
the gear icon in the audio area) you have several more options.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You can add various filters, such as noise reduction.</p></li>
<li><p>You can group audio sources into various <strong>audio tracks</strong>, and the
stream/recordings can use different tracks.  For example, a person
may stream with music but leave that out of the recorded video.  Or,
you might record a video with two different audio tracks, one just
the presenter and one with presenter + audience.</p></li>
<li><p>You can monitor the audio, which plays what is being recorded back
over the headphones and speakers for you to check.  Make sure you
don’t make any loops!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Audio configuration is a big deal.  You can look at thees other
guides:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>???</p></li>
</ul>
<p>High-quality audio is quite important.  I’ve spent far too long
playing with it, and my conclusion is that I don’t know enough to make
it better than what I have now.  I could use a better microphone, but
then I had to add noise reduction and the quality ended up the same as
a “worse” headset microphone that was close to my mouth that seemed to
have automatic noise reduction.  Your environment (noise, amount of
echo) matters just as much as your microphone.</p>
<p>I propose a central recommendation: <em>talk about audio quality</em>.  Start
meetings early and test it.  Communicate about problems early, don’t
ignore and think it’s “good enough for now”.</p>

<h4>Recording and streaming<a class="headerlink" href="#recording-and-streaming" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>Once you have done the above, you can record and stream by clicking
the buttons.</p>
<p>One piece of advice: always keep the recording going, and then
stop/restart it when you need to cut.  It’s easier to delete the
unnecessary segments than realize you forgot to push “record”.</p>

<div class="section" id="projector-and-loopback-output">
<h4>Projector and loopback output<a class="headerlink" href="#projector-and-loopback-output" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>Beyond recording and streaming, there are several more ways to use the
output that can feed into other applications.</p>
<p>With <strong>projectors</strong> you can display the scene locally on another
monitor or window.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>fullscreen projector</strong> displays the scene to a monitor.  As
the name says, this could be used to send it to an external
projector or capture card via HDMI.  Or even preview locally, or
screenshared in an online meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>windowed projector</strong> does similar, but makes a new window that
can be moved and resized.  This can be captured as a single-window
screenshare in an online meeting.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>loopback output</strong> creates a <strong>virtual camera device</strong>.  This
appears to other applications as a camera, just like the camera that
captures your video.
Other applications can use this as the input just like another
webcam.  So, you could make a fancy scene that is used instead of your
normal camera’s picture.
Or, in Zoom you can share screen from “second camera” -
which would use this scene.  (Note in Zoom it will interpret it as a
landscape picture, regardless of what aspect ration you actually use.
Thus, this isn’t very suitable for vertical screen sharing.)</p>

<p>We have a public broadcast, with goes out via a livestream.

people can watch via the livestream alone.  Or there can be different
meetings.  Or people could watch recorded videos later.</p>
<p>The mental model here is “Watching TV together”.  We collectively watch
a show together.  There are periodic intermissions where each watching
community discusses among themselves and works on the exercises.
Everyone feels they are a part of something big and that keeps people interested.</p>
<p>We have clear communication channels from learner→instructor
(HackMD), helpers→instructors (chat), instructors→learners
(livestream).  Of course instructors can directly communicate with the audience
during their breaks.</p>

<h3>Instructors<a class="headerlink" href="#instructors" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>There is an <strong>instructor Zoom meeting</strong>.  This is broadcasted via
Twitch, using <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-obs"><span class="doc">OBS</span></a> (there is usually a separate director
or production manager for this, instructors don’t need to worry
themselves with this).</p>
<p>Compared to the classic style, advantages include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You are freed from student management, others help manage the
audience and convey these important parts to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Audio/video is muted during breaks, there is more opportunity to
discuss and plan what comes next with the instructors.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You lose the direct access to all students (but how often would
someone speak up anyway?).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Instructors should keep in mind (many of these are not special to the
MOOC format, but are even more important):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>At all times you will have a director to help keep you on track:
just teach and watch chat (and HackMD when you have time, but others
do this and let you know).</p></li>
<li><p>You will have a private Zoom meeting with only instructors (and any
other key helpers who want to be there).</p></li>
<li><p>Share a vertical screen (840 × 1080 is our standard and your
maximum).  This allows students
to keep half of their screen open for their own work.</p></li>
<li><p>HackMD is the main way of receiving questions from students (just
like in our current courses).  The HackMD helper can be in the
main stream to immediately ask questions from the audience, or your
co-instructors could do this.  Really, perhaps both.</p></li>
<li><p>During breaks and pauses, the livestream will be muted, so that
instructors (and helpers there) can talk without the audience
hearing.  This greatly increases professionalism and makes it easier
to coordinate.</p></li>
<li><p>There is the standard text chat (Zulip) to use to communicate with
other helpers.</p></li>
<li><p>Of course, you can go join the student room during breaks, other
sessions, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>Zoom polls won’t work, since the instructors and audience aren’t in
the same Zoom meeting.  This is one reason we already use HackMD for
polls (though there are other options, such as presemo.aalto.fi,
which could work in even larger courses).</p></li>
<li><p>You will have more than just the registered students in another room
as an audience.  Your audience includes students in the breakout
room meeting, livestream watchers, people in their own meetings with
a private team we don’t know about, people broadcasting it to
physical rooms, people watching recordings later, and who knows who
else.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Try to speak with awareness of this diverse audience.  You don’t
need to change much, but go slowly and give plenty of time, and
you can say things like “If you are registered, … .  If you are
on your own, … .”</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat back questions before answering them, so that people across
channels can follow.  This is a usually good idea anyway, and also
it is natural when questions are coming through chat or notes.</p></li>
<li><p>Speak in terms of breaks and exercises sessions.</p></li>
<li><p>Speak in terms of relative times, since people will be in different
timezones.  For example, say “We resume at
50 minutes past the hour” and write “xx:50”.</p></li>
<li><p>Realize there are different learning styles.  Some people will
attempt all exercises.  Some will passive watch and want demos.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>We propose this general model for each lecture-exercise cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Give the lecture part</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce the exercises</p></li>
<li><p>Short break (~5 minutes).  People attempting exercises themselves
go into their other meetings and work on it.  The learners
attempting it themselves will mute the stream.</p></li>
<li><p>On-stream, do the exercise as a type-along or demo.  This is useful
for some audience, and also is very useful in recordings.</p></li>
<li><p>At the designated time, the learners come back to the livestream.
Depending on what you want, you could use the outcome of the demo
to discuss what we learned, do a whole new demo (perhaps faster
this time), or you go on.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>You should also make it clear to the audience (mainly
helpers/exercise leaders) what the expectation for each exercise
session is.  This should be written in the HackMD!</p></li>
<li><p>It is OK to decide you can’t make things perfect for every audience.
The rest will understand this if you make this explicit.</p></li>

<h3>Director<a class="headerlink" href="#director" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>You job is to be aware of everything going on, and when there is a
question like “Do we need more time?” or “what should we do now?”, you
can answer it.  You can give people the pushes when they get slightly
off track (though others should always be willing to speak up when
this is needed, too).  You maintain this awareness by watching as many
of the communication channels as you can.</p>
<p>Hint: find your computer’s detailed audio controls, so that you can
adjust volumes of multiple sources independently.  This helps you be
in multiple meetings at once.  (This may be useful for others that
want to attend multiple meetings.)</p>

<h3>Expert helpers and other staff<a class="headerlink" href="#expert-helpers-and-other-staff" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>As a helper, your job stays pretty much the same.  There is more
emphasis on making sure that all questions and comments are in the
HackMD.</p>
<p>Some helpers can join the instructor meeting and directly relay
questions and thoughts, and in general provide the “voice of the
audience”.  This is a logical role for the HackMD helper.</p>

<h3>Audience and exercise leaders<a class="headerlink" href="#audience-and-exercise-leaders" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>

<h4>In the main meeting with breakouts<a class="headerlink" href="#in-the-main-meeting-with-breakouts" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>Here, there is a meeting (e.g. Zoom) which has a lot of learners in
it.  There are two options for lectures:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Meeting host shares the livestream (video + audio)</p></li>
<li><p>Participants individually open the livestream and watch, and go back
to the meeting when it is time to do exercises.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All audience members ask questions and discuss in HackMD (just like in
regular workshops).  The meeting chat is mainly used for
practicalities, and is not designed to be monitored by the audience.</p>
<p>The most significant risk here is that learners have to mute the
livestream (or turn it off) during the exercise sessions if there are
demos going on while they are doing exercises.  This means we may have
trouble getting their attention.</p>

two helpers per workshop.  We’ve noticed that helper diversity
promotes learning, so we recommend that organizers also make proactive
steps to have diverse helpers (male/female, international, etc.).
Local organizers should directly contact possible helpers and invite them.</p>

<p>My name is NAME and I work as a XXX in YYY. I’m contacting you now to spread the word about a workshop which I am co-organizing in LOCATION together with the CodeRefinery project (http://coderefinery.org/) organized under the NeIC organization. I found your contact information via ZZZ…</p>
<p>CodeRefinery (http://coderefinery.org) aims to reach out to diverse academic communities which use and develop software in their research, and advocate more modern and efficient software development methods (such as collaborative distributed version control, automated testing, code documentation, managing code complexity, etc). CodeRefinery is not about efficient code, but rather efficient coding, and experience has shown that researchers have a lot to gain from our course material!</p>
<p>A CodeRefinery workshop is planned for LOCATION in CITY on DATE, see the website here: URL</p>
<p>The most natural audience for our workshops is PhD students and postdocs, but both more junior and senior people may find it valuable to attend.</p>

Engage in the successful CodeRefinery workshop program, by becoming a tutor for
the exercise sessions and discussion groups.  If you have been to a
CodeRefinery workshop, you will have experienced  a very hands-on approach to
training with frequent exercise sessions and group discussions.  In online
workshops these sessions take place in breakout rooms with 5-7 participants and
1-2 workshop tutors.  Tutors answer questions from the learners, guide them
through the exercises and try to keep time.  If needed, tutors can call on
experienced trainers in the background to help answer tricky questions.  The
tutors are an important part of the CodeRefinery teaching concept and all the
workshops to scale to many more people than the instructors could  otherwise
manage!

If you have previously attended a CodeRefinery workshop, and/or use some of the
tools and methods covered in a workshop (Git, software testing, modern
documentation platforms etc.), then please consider joining a CodeRefinery
workshop as a tutor! Being a tutor is fun, it expands your network and develops
your teaching and mentoring skills.  You always learn something new about a
subject by teaching it!

If you would like to help on the upcoming workshop in November, please sign up
as a tutor on https://coderefinery.github.io/2020-11-17-online/.  If you would

Dear CodeRefinery alumnus,

We hope that you enjoyed participating in a CodeRefinery workshop last semester and that it was 
beneficial for your work and research! We don’t keep an attendance list, so apologies to those 
of you who couldn&#39;t make it to the workshop...

Please help us to improve our course material and teaching methods by answering our very brief questionnaire at 
https://indico.neic.no/event/109/
about whether and how the CodeRefinery workshop affected how you develop code. 
All information you provide will be useful. Your participation is extremely valuable 
and will help us to develop the project further. The average time to fill the form is around 5 minutes.

Would you be interested in being a helper or instructor in future workshops? It&#39;s a great way to continue 
developing your skills and expanding your network! We&#39;re always interested in recruiting new helpers 
and instructors. If this sounds interesting to you, please get in touch by writing to

<h4>Practical info (online)<a class="headerlink" href="#practical-info-online" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>The online CodeRefinery workshop TITLE is approaching! It will take place on DATE at START - END in Zoom room ZOOMID.
On the first day, we also have an optional session starting half an hour before START where you can connect,
test your video client and iron out any technical issues (we recommend attending this if you haven’t used Zoom before).</p>
<p>If it turns out that you cannot attend, please let us know as soon as possible so that we can offer your seat to someone on the waiting list.</p>
<p>We will be using a Zoom room with ID ZOOMID. We recommend that you install the Zoom client (https://zoom.us/download).
In order to join the room you will need the password ZOOMPASSWORD.
You will be encouraged (but not forced) to use a webcam during the workshop.
If you don’t want the physical room you’re in to be visible on the webcam, Zoom allows users to set up a virtual background:
https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/210707503-Virtual-Background
You might also be asked to share your screen during group exercises or in interactions with a workshop helper.
Remember to keep private information away from the screen you share!</p>
<p>You are expected to install some software on your computers before the workshop starts.
Please visit the workshop webpage WORKSHOPURL and go through each tool under “Software requirements”,
and install whatever you’re missing before the workshop starts. Note that you also need to create some accounts.
Note that each of these tools/accounts can easily be removed/deactivated after the workshop, if you so wish (see https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/accounts/).</p>
<p>Don’t hesitate to get in touch (support&#64;coderefinery.org) if you run into any installation problems or have questions relating
to Zoom or other practical details. Note that we maintain a list of common installation issues that can occur at https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/troubleshooting/</p>
<p>If you haven’t already filled the pre-workshop survey, please do that soon since it helps us with workshop preparation.
You can find it at: SURVEYURL.</p>
<p>The workshop will be very focused on version control with Git. Some of you are already familiar with Git, but not all.
While we will be starting from the basics, we will be progressing quickly so it’s useful if you spend a few minutes to read up on the basic idea of Git.
For this purpose, we have prepared this “refresher” material: https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/
Note that this material also contains important Git configuration steps which all of you should go through before the workshop starts, to save valuable time during the workshop.</p>
<p>CodeRefinery strives to follow the Code of Conduct developed by The Carpentries organisation. Please have a look at
https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html so that we all are aware of how to treat each other respectfully.</p>
<p>Don’t hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions!</p>
<p>Best,
MYNAME</p>

<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>The CodeRefinery CITY workshop on DATE is approaching! The location and schedule
is available on the workshop webpage: URL</p>
<p>If it turns out that you cannot attend, please let us know as soon as possible
so that we can offer your seat to someone on the waiting list.</p>
<p>You are expected to install some software on your laptops before the workshop
starts. Please visit the workshop webpage (URL) and go through each tool under
“Software requirements”, and install whatever you’re missing before the workshop
starts. Note that you also need a couple of accounts (GitHub and Read the Docs).
Note that each of these tools/accounts can easily be removed/deactivated after
the workshop, if you so wish (see https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/accounts/).</p>
<p>Don’t hesitate to get in touch (support&#64;coderefinery.org) if you run into any
installation problems. We also maintain a list of common installation issues

<p>The workshop will have a strong focus on version control with Git. Some of you
are already somewhat familiar with Git, but not all. While we will be starting
from the basics, we will be progressing quickly so it’s useful if you spend
10-20 minutes to read up on the basic idea of Git. For this purpose, we have
prepared this “refresher” material:
https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/</p>
<p>Please have a look at this material before the workshop starts. Note that it

<h3>Recording of sessions<a class="headerlink" href="#recording-of-sessions" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>If you plan on recording and publishing the session, prepare in advance so that
you don’t have a difficult editing job later.
Make sure that you (or users) don’t show any personal or confidential information.
Think about what happens if users speak: do you ask for permission to publish
in advance (maybe encouraging people not to), or edit it out later (taking
your time later).</p>
<p>If you plan to record the session, make sure that everybody is aware that the
sessions is recorded, informed about how the recording will be used, and gives
consent to be recorded:
<a class="reference external" href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360026909191-Consent-to-be-Recorded">https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360026909191-Consent-to-be-Recorded</a></p>
<p>In Zoom it’s important to start recording in the form you want the video to be
in (e.g. start recording when screen is shared so that it stays there):

less distracting.</p>

<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Welcome to the registration page for the CodeRefinery instructor training workshop in Stockholm!

To complete your registration, you need to:

1) Enter your registration details by clicking the &quot;Apply now&quot; button below.
2) Fill in the pre-workshop survey by clicking the &quot;Fill out the survey&quot; button below.

Confirmation email
After filling out the registration form you will receive an automatic confirmation email but please note that your registration is only tentative until we confirm it with another (human-written) email which should happen typically within a week.

Waiting list
We maintain a waiting list for seats but this is currently not automatic so we need this short time buffer to manually confirm participants and inform those who are on the waiting list.

First come, first serve
The seats are assigned on a first come first serve basis but we need to also make sure that registered participants are affiliated with a Nordic academic institution since the course is free for participants and financed by the Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (unless this is an event outside of Nordics funded by a different organization).

Cancellation
We ask confirmed participants who are not able to participate at the course they have signed up for, to inform us as soon as possible so that people on the waiting list can take the vacant seat.

Questions?
If you have any questions about your registration status, please write to support@coderefinery.org.

Looking forward to seeing you at the workshop!

<h2>Icebreakers<a class="headerlink" href="#icebreakers" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This is a list of possible icebreaker questions.</p>
<p>You should make it very clear that <em>everyone</em> should answer the
question, and thus it should be very broad.  The point is to make sure
they know how to use the tools.  Make sure that the question feels
inclusive - not just that people can answer, but that it doesn’t make
people feel they are far behind others.</p>
<p>If you ask people to add there name as part of an introduction, the
document becomes personal data and must be controlled more, and sets
you on a path to extensive editing before it can be released.  Think
before you do this - maybe you just ask for information about
backgrounds without names.</p>

<li><p><strong>Filename</strong>: you don’t need the full filename but indicate what

<li><p>How small should segments be?  First, it’s better for videos to exist
than be perfect, so the 3-hour segment is better than nothing.  Short
lessons (1.5 hour) are probably fine to be at once, and long ones (git
intro/collab) could possibly be each episode separately.  Discuss with
others to see what you would like.</p></li>
<li><p>Ideally, there are two videos from each day: one recorded by Twitch
(raw dump of the stream), and one recorded by OBS/Zoom (local
recording).  The OBS/Zoom recording is preferable.  You can tell

<p>The purpose of this page is to give video processing volunteers a
starting point.  (It also has some hints for workshop organizers).</p>
<p>For some of our online lessons, we release videos on YouTube.  This is
not necessarily for brand new people to watch and learn the material
(though they may), but especially for people who attended the workshop
to review what they saw.  As such, it’s more important to get them
published fast, than make them perfect.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-want">
<h3>What we want<a class="headerlink" href="#what-we-want" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Our workshops consist of lectures, demo, and exercises in breakout
rooms.  We record the main Zoom room, and also livestream the main
room via Twitch.  We would like the video of the workshop to be
processed so that it can be released on YouTube.  This should not be a
major production: it is more useful to those who want to review what
they saw in person, rather than a new person watching.</p>
<p>We will provide the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Raw video files (probably two copies one recorded from Zoom and one
from Twitch - so there is a backup.)</p></li>
<li><p>List of lessons (= final videos) and which raw files contain them
and when.</p></li>
<li><p>List of instructors</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We want out:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>One processed video file per lesson.</p></li>
<li><p>With irrelevant breaks removed.</p></li>
<li><p>Without any video from learners.  We use Zoom so that learners
should not appear in the stream, but we can’t be sure it works so
this needs to be checked.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The rough process is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Load up the right video files in the editor.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the start of the lesson (hint: look for a change of
instructor - ask us if you need help!) and cut off the stuff before.</p></li>
<li><p>Watch through the videos.  Most of the lecture parts are fairly
standard and can be fast-forwarded through (it’s rare for a
learner’s picture to appear here).</p></li>
<li><p>Cut out the idle time during breaks.</p></li>
<li><p>In exercise sessions, learners go to breakout rooms, which are not
recorded.  This part can be cut out, <em>but</em> sometimes the instructor
stays in the main room to do the exercises for the stream.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t be too precise.  We aren’t trying to make a masterpiece to end
all masterpieces, but a something for those who were at the workshop
to refer back to.  So:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Imprecise start/stop/break times are fine</p></li>
<li><p>Other random off-topic chat is fine</p></li>
<li><p>Voices of learners is fine and expected</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Video</strong> of learners is <strong>not ok</strong> (really, this is the only
thing that needs care).</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Before/during/immediately after the workshop<a class="headerlink" href="#before-during-immediately-after-the-workshop" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>From day 1, advertise that “the workshop may be recorded and put on
YouTube.  We will prevent any pictures and names from going there,
but your voice may be.  Please don’t include your name in hackmd
unless you accept it may be published.  We support your right to be
anonymous in this workshop.”</p></li>
<li><p>Same announcement at the start of the workshop.</p></li>
<li><p>Record in zoom.  Note: when you start the recording, make sure that
someone is currently sharing the screen, <em>and</em> the screen is a good
size (e.g. normal Full HD, as opposed to some vertical shape).  The
dimensions when the sharing first starts determines the dimensions
for the entire course.</p></li>
<li><p>Immediately after workshop, go to Twitch and download the raw
streamed version.  You have to be logged in as the channel, then the
option is naturally provided to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose some standard, shared place and immediately upload videos

<div class="section" id="processing">
<h3>Processing<a class="headerlink" href="#processing" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Processing principles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Remove any participant videos, if they accidentally make it into
the video file</strong>.  This is really the only serious rule in the
processing, if we didn’t have to check this we could just upload the
raw ones and it would be good enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Create one final video per lesson in the workshop</p></li>
<li><p>Work incrementally, upload processed ones when you can, get quick
feedback.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If it’s not clear, the course organizers will provide a list of the
lessons (final outputs) and the respective inputs (which source files
go into it).</p>
<p>You can generally:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use some video editor</p>
<ul>
<li><p>iMovie on Mac</p></li>
<li><p>OpenShot is a simple cross-platform editor (<a class="reference external" href="https://cdn.openshot.org/static/files/user-guide/quick_tutorial.html">tutorial</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>(please give more ideas here)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>(so far, this is not a general “how to edit video” guide… you will
need to find one for your editing program)</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new project for the output (e.g. the Jupyter lesson)</p></li>
<li><p>Import the raw video files which contain Jupyter (e.g. day 4).  If
one lesson is split over multiple files, combine them.</p></li>
<li><p>Cut off the part before and after the lesson itself (saving
frequently).  You’ll have to figure out the start and end times,
this may be hard when there are several files.</p></li>
<li><p>Begin watching the lesson.  Look for the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Break time?  Exercise session with irrelevant stuff in the video?
Cut the time out.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Any non-instructors pictures in the stream?</strong>  Cut it out.
Sometimes you might need to blank the picture while</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t be too perfectionist - the goal is to get something done,
not maek the perfect videos.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Export the videos with a high quality, e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">jupyter.mp4</span></code>.  It
will go to YouTube which will render lower resolutions, so you don’t
need to worry about this so much.</p></li>
<li><p>Upload the videos to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">processed</span></code> subdirectory of the google
drive.  Do this immediately, video by video.  It’s better to get
continuous feedback on this.  You are done!</p></li>

<p>This is a checklist and hints when writing and designing a new lesson.
The master material is in Teaching Tech Together, primarily chapters 6
and 12 for practicalities and 2 and 4 for big picture considerations.
But really, all the book.  See <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-teaching-tech-together"><span class="doc std std-doc">the summary we
made</span></a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://teachtogether.tech/">the actual

effective lesson</a> is
also a good summary of the main points.
Finally, the <a class="reference external" href="https://cdh.carpentries.org/">Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook</a> gives practical information on how to design a new lesson and covers the entire lesson life-cycle with a good overview of the lesson release timeline.</p>
<p>This doesn’t replace your own knowledge in doing the actual teaching
part.  Instead, the first half gives pointers on making sure your
audience can connect to the material, and the last half gives hints
to help you come up with good exercises and examples.</p>

teach.  What do they care about?  Perhaps as important is what they
don’t care about: make sure that you don’t go too in depth too
early and turn people off.</p></li>
<li><p>Create some summative assessments, that show what learners should
learn by the end.  Try to connect these to the learner personas.</p></li>
<li><p>Create formative assessments (exercises) that let the learners
practice what you want them to learn.  See below for hints on coming
up with good exercises.  These should also connect to things the
learners will actually do, but can also be more of checkpoints.</p></li>
<li><p>Put exercises in a logical order, and fill in any gaps.  Ideally
there should be 15-20 min of teaching between each exercise.  Perhaps
most are short (a few longer examples as needed), to identify a
certain learning goal and misconception.</p></li>
<li><p>Write just enough material to get from one exercise to the other.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The most important point here is to start from learner’s needs and how
they can feel connected, not from the tech details.</p>
<p>When advertising the course, connect it to your learner personas so
that you get the right audience and they know why they should come.</p>

<h3>Emotional and intrinsic appeal, other basics<a class="headerlink" href="#emotional-and-intrinsic-appeal-other-basics" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>You can think of why people should feel emotionally connected to your
material - maybe it’s too much to expect people to get emotionally
invested, but if you try for that, you’ll end somewhere better.</p>
<p>Try to design around tasks and exercises which your audience will care
about.  For example, don’t say “here are some shell commands”, but
“aren’t you tired of copying all of these files one by one… check
out the shell… once you know it, you will really feel at home.  Here
are some typical things you might do.”.  Intrinsic motivators include
<strong>sense of agency</strong> (being able to do things themselves), <strong>competence</strong>
(usefulness of what they are doing, feeling they know something), and
<strong>relatedness</strong> (doing things that others are doing).</p>
<p>A manual is reference, a tutorial builds a cognitive model.  If you
can build the cognitive model and tell them the “why”, students may be
able to refer to the manuals themselves and become self-sufficient.
Thus, teaching should be more of a
tutorial, with good links to manuals (it can also explicitly teach
how to use the manuals).</p>
<p>Perhaps a related point is inclusiveness: make sure there’s not some
“in” crowd.  Perhaps the best description I have seen: don’t assume
that some people are missing something, but that others have had the
fortune of learning it earlier.  This may not matter in a purely
factual lesson design, but if you are trying to make things
intrinsically or emotionally appealing, it is essential.</p>

<h3>Who is the audience?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-is-the-audience" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Making the <strong>learner personas</strong> are essential to making a good lesson,
even if you think you know who you are teaching to.  This is because
it grounds you into what your audience already knows (or doesn’t know)
and what they are interested in.</p>
<p>You also have different ways people can refer to the material:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In a class, with an instructor guiding them</p></li>
<li><p>Reading along by themselves</p></li>

<h3>Writing<a class="headerlink" href="#writing" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>There is not much here yet, mostly just follow the “backwards lesson design”
above.  The hardest part is coming up with good exercises, so our
practical advice is to mix and match from the two taxonomies at the
bottom and the exercise types.  Try to think of diverse types of
exercises.</p>
<p>Exercise design is the time it is most useful to be with others to do
brainstorming, so we highly recommend discussing with others at this
point.  Because exercises are used to set the overall outline of the
lesson, this also gives people a say in the overall outline - in a
very concrete way.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Make sure you include the emotional starting point at the beginning - why
should you care and why is this cool?</p></li>
<li><p>This should also be at the start and end of each section: not just what
or how, but why?</p></li>
<li><p>Part of this is also having a <strong>student’s guide</strong>, so that
people independently studying can know how to follow the material.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s OK to have more material than can be presented or than people
should know, but <em>label things well</em>, including <em>labeling the difficulty</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the beginning, what sections are expected to be taught in
short/long versions?  What’s advanced/optional?</p></li>
<li><p>Label advanced and optional sections as such.  Perhaps also really
basic sections that can be skipped for that reason.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Plan for mixed abilities.  It’s OK to have optional (basic) and
advanced sections, as long as they are clearly labeled.  Mainly, don’t
have people think that you are uncoordinated because you are skipping
advanced sections.</p>
<p>Once you are done, update maintainer’s and instructor’s guides.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introduction-and-conclusion">
<h3>Introduction (and conclusion)<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-and-conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The introduction is the first thing people hear, and needs special
thought.  Don’t start with a cold open, just going straight to the
topic (“what” or “how”).  Instead, have some careful motivation
(“why”).  It could be especially good to talk about what is wrong with
the current state of affairs (give a good, simple example) and why it
should be improved.  Then start talking about what the improvements
are.</p>
<p>Ideally, the introduction should serve as an self-contained abstract
of your material.  If you need to teach your lesson in only 10% of the
time you have, can you use just the introduction to do it?</p>
<p>Conclusion should remind people about why this is cool and discuss
what comes next.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="thinking-of-exercises">
<h3>Thinking of exercises<a class="headerlink" href="#thinking-of-exercises" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Not every exercise has to be an amazing hand-on example.  It’s mixing
with smaller, more conceptual things to reduce the cognitive load and
be able to have more frequent exercises.</p>
<p>One of your other primary goals should be to make your exercises
<em>relevant</em>.  Abstract will lead to disconnection. Connect the exercises
to the real world.  Also, can you tell a complete story with
exercises?  (Remember, in backwards lesson design, the exercises
form the story of the lesson.)</p>
<p>Remember that not every exercise has to be long.  Try to have
frequent short exercises to get immediate feedback, with some long
ones.</p>
<p>Good exercises are the most important factor in a good lesson.  Even
if you are preparing the rest of the lesson mostly alone, consider a
good long brainstorming session to go from “list of topics to cover”
to “sequence of exercises”.</p>
<p>When you are stuck thinking “how can I make an exercise that covers
X”, think of the lists below inspiration.  Not every exercise has to be an
sophisticated hands-on thing, so don’t be afraid to use different
types:</p>
<p>Basic types:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Multiple choice (easy to get feedback via a classroom tool - try to
design each wrong answer so that it identifies a specific
misconception).</p></li>
<li><p>Code yourself (traditional programming)</p></li>
<li><p>Code yourself + multiple choice to see what the answer is (allows
you to get feedback)</p></li>
<li><p>Inverted coding (given code, have to debug)</p></li>
<li><p>Parsons problems (working solution but lines in random order,
learner must only put in proper order)</p></li>
<li><p>Fill in the blank</p></li>
</ul>
<p>More advanced:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Tracing execution</p></li>
<li><p>Tracing values through code flow (e.g. what is the sequence of
values that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span></code> takes on?)</p></li>
<li><p>Reverse execution (find input that gives an output)</p></li>
<li><p>Minimal fix (given broken code, make it work)</p></li>
<li><p>Theme and variations (working code, adapt to other type of
situation/problem)</p></li>
<li><p>Refactoring</p></li>
</ul>
<p>More conceptual:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Draw a diagram</p></li>
<li><p>Label diagram</p></li>
<li><p>Matching problem: two sets of Q/A, match them.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thinking through the learning taxonomies also helps to come up with
diverse types of exercises:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Bloom’s taxonomy: hierarchical skill levels (can you help students
to “grow a level”?):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remembering</p></li>
<li><p>Understanding</p></li>
<li><p>Applying</p></li>
<li><p>Analyzing</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluating</p></li>
<li><p>Creating</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Fink’s taxonomy: complementary types instead of hierarchical:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Foundational knowledge</p></li>
<li><p>Applications</p></li>
<li><p>Integration</p></li>
<li><p>Human dimension</p></li>
<li><p>Caring</p></li>
<li><p>Learning how to learn</p></li>

<p>Remember to keep the <em>story</em> of the lesson in mind.  Many people are

<span id="voting"></span><h3>Reacting and voting<a class="headerlink" href="#reacting-and-voting" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>We want everyone to take part in chat and express their thoughts, but
of course people don’t want to give pointless agreeing replies (but
you can always welcome to do that, too).  So, we encourage everyone to
use reactions in cases they want to express agreement/disagreement but
not so much they want to send a message.  Common reactions you might
see are 👍, 👎 (thumbs up/down, agree with general sentiment), 🐙
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:octopus:</span></code>, awesome/amazing/ace), and well, plenty more that are
obvious.</p>
<p>We also use reactions to express some idea of a more concrete
<strong>vote</strong>, to empower people to take an action (otherwise, it is
difficult to get a decision on anything).  This is not formal or
necessarily binding (so it’s not really a vote), but a useful
intermediate system for a young project.  If you see a message
proposing something and you want to say, in no uncertain terms, “I
think you should do that” or not, let us know by the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>↔️ (+0, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:left_right:</span></code>: I see this and am neutral.</p></li>
<li><p>🔼, 🔽 (+1, -1, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:upvote:</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:downvote:</span></code>) or similar: I
agree/disagree with this.</p></li>
<li><p>⏬, ⏫ (+2, -2, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:double_up:</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:double_down:</span></code>): I agree/disagree
with this and am willing to work on making it happen/finding an
alternative.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to do something, ask for opinions, and a reasonable time
later it seems the sentiment is positive, consider yourself empowered
to do it.  If you are voting, feel free to be creative with emojis or
numbers, but realize that other reactions may not be so explicit.  Note
that if you are negative, you should explain why or alternatives,
otherwise your opinion may not be weighted so much.  The person doing
the thing decides what to do (and this is open source: we find a way
for everyone to do what they need to do).</p>
<p>Do you think you aren’t important enough to vote?  That’s wrong,
because we are usually interested in the thoughts of outsiders.  We
can see who voted and use that to weight our decision if needed.</p>

<h2>Contributing to CodeRefinery<a class="headerlink" href="#contributing-to-coderefinery" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>CodeRefinery is an open-source project.  All our work is open, and we
accept any type of contributions: there is a lot more than instructing
to run a successful workshop.</p>
<p>If you aren’t sure you are ready for more, you can always {ref}<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lurk</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">chat</span> <span class="pre">&lt;chat&gt;</span></code>
(passively watch our community) and become more active when you feel
the time is right.</p>
<p>These manuals (and in general, other guides we have) describe the
past, not (only) the future.  They are made so that new people can
know what we typically have done, so they can work on the future (even
if it’s different).</p>
<p>A good way to get started is to take the lead of some workshop (doing
it like it was before), then do it again with your own improvements.</p>

<h3>Types of contributions<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-contributions" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Some examples of what you can do…</p>
<p>Quick things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fix issues in our lessons, or at least point out problems you see!</p></li>
<li><p>Contribute to lessons.</p></li>
<li><p>Help us advertise CodeRefinery to others who can benefit.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A bit more commitment:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Invite us to give a workshop, serve as a local host and help ensure
there are lots of attendees</p></li>
<li><p>Be a helper with in our workshops.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Get really involved:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Hang out on our <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#chat"><span class="std std-ref">CodeRefinery chat</span></a></p></li>
<li><p>Teach a lesson using our materials yourself</p></li>
<li><p>Be come a CodeRefinery instructor</p></li>
<li><p>Come to our meetings several times a month.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="example-volunteer-packages">
<span id="volunteering"></span><h3>Example volunteer “packages”<a class="headerlink" href="#example-volunteer-packages" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This section gives examples of types of packages you can present to
your supervisor to make CodeRefinery a part of your job!  Of course,
we are happy with pure volunteers, but we accept that most people have
another job and if you can get benefits for your job, you’ll have much
more time for CodeRefinery.</p>
<p>Clearly, these aren’t the only ways to contribute, but we thought that
giving some concrete plans will help people:</p>
<div class="section" id="instructor">
<h4>Instructor<a class="headerlink" href="#instructor" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>.. seealso::</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>{doc}`instructor-intro`
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As an instructor, you become an expert in CodeRefinery materials by
continual co-working with CodeRefinery staff.  You will really be able
to help all of your staff</p>
<p>Teach at 4/workshops per year (4 × 3 days) + 50% preparation time
commitment.  Attend one CodeRefinery workshop per year.</p>
<p>How to get started: be an exercise leader a few times, read through the instructor notes and find a topic you are interested and comfortable teaching, then when we are planning a workshop, offer to teach that lesson.  We’ll help you get
started. Also co-teaching is a possibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="helper">
<h4>Helper<a class="headerlink" href="#helper" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>.. seealso::</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>{doc}`helper-intro`
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As a helper, you have less demands outside of workshops, but you get
to become very familiar with CodeRefinery material.  You especially
get skills in mentoring and debugging.  This is a perfect position for
the “local expert” of a research group, who will guide all of their
members through getting started with scientific computing.  A helper
can include all of our non-instructor roles: exercise leader, expert helper,
Zoom host, etc.</p>
<p>Example time commitment: 4 workshops/year (4 × 3 days) + 20%
preparation time commitment.</p>
<p>How to get started: Read about being an exercise leader on our <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#helper-intro"><span class="std std-ref">Exercise leader intro page</span></a>. Watch our announcements and sign up as an exercise leader for the next workshop.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lesson-maintainer">
<h4>Lesson maintainer<a class="headerlink" href="#lesson-maintainer" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>We have a lot of lessons, and it always helps to have someone keep an
eye on them and make sure issues and pull requests go thorough.  While
theoretically everyone helps with this, it’s good to have someone keep
a close watch and make sure there is an overall order to things.  In
return, you get extensive experience in the topic and experience
working on an open source project.</p>
<p>Quite often, the current maintainer is the person who last did a major
re-working of the lesson and an instructor (either active or at the
final limits of their activity).</p>
<p>Example time commitment: 20-50 hours/year/lesson, plus attending our
yearly CodeRefinery workshop and meetings several times a month.</p>
<p>How to get started: Watch the GitHub issues and be the first one to
answer them.  Review pull requests, and if things make sense to you
then submit a review saying “Approved”.  Eventually, you become the
recognized specialist.  Ask us or we’ll notice, and ask you to become
a maintainer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fan">
<h4>Fan<a class="headerlink" href="#fan" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>Hang out in the chat and help others, provide advice to others, give
feedback of our ideas.  Lurk in all of our other activities and decide
if you want to do more later.  Help us advertise workshops, get
exercise leaders, get learners, do outreach.  Perhaps start showing up as an
expert helper sometimes.</p>
<p>Example time commitment: ???</p>
<p>How to get started: join <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#chat"><span class="std std-ref">CodeRefinery zulipchat</span></a> and see what
comes up.</p>

<div class="section" id="organizer">
<h4>Organizer<a class="headerlink" href="#organizer" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>Help us organize workshops. Each workshop needs a handfull of different roles to be filled: You can handle attendee communication,

<h2>About CodeRefinery<a class="headerlink" href="#about-coderefinery" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<div class="section" id="history">
<h3>History<a class="headerlink" href="#history" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>CodeRefinery began as a Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC)
based off of some previous workshops at the KTH, Stockholm.  The first
round of funding was from 2016 - 2018, and a second round is going from
2018-2021.  Thus, so far, it has always had some paid staff (each up
to 0.5 full-time equivalent of their primary jobs).  Most of these
staff are from some sort of computing center.</p>
<p>Over time, it has evolved into a more open project direction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="governance">
<h3>Governance<a class="headerlink" href="#governance" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>There is a steering group within NeIC which governs the CodeRefinery
project.  However, strictly speaking that mainly covers activities done
via NeIC funding.  The materials and open-source project is open to all.</p>
<p>There are currently no formal decision making processes.  Typically,
decisions related to some repository go through the process of…</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Submit an issue or pull request</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss in the issue and/or</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss in a CodeRefinery team meeting</p></li>
<li><p>If there is rough consensus, then commit it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In general, most decisions (of the open project) result in some sort
of commit in git.  If the reaction is positive in a CodeRefinery
meeting, then it’s accepted.  (Most day-to-day things aren’t discussed
in the meetings, only major things affecting the whole project.)
In general, if you are open and discuss, then do what will improve the
project for you.</p>

<div class="section" id="team-meetings">
<h4>Team meetings<a class="headerlink" href="#team-meetings" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>These tend to happen every ~2 weeks.  Mainly, we discuss NeIC project,

<div class="section" id="github">
<h4>Github<a class="headerlink" href="#github" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>

<h3>Core team<a class="headerlink" href="#core-team" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>

<h3>Joining<a class="headerlink" href="#joining" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>There is currently no formal joining process.  Take part, and
contribute as you would like.</p>
<p>The usual way of joining would be to decide how CodeRefinery has to
adapt to serve your needs, and start proposing ways to do that.
Reading existing pull requests and giving a comment of “approve” is a
great way to get noticed.</p>
