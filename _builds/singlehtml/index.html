<h3>Take the workshop seriously<a class="headerlink" href="#take-the-workshop-seriously" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It’s easy to think “it’s just online, it’s easy to passively watch”.
However, for an interactive workshop you do need to take part to get
the most of out it, and our workshops are targeted to that.  If you
read this page and the workshop prerequisites, you should be OK.</p>
<p><em>Don’t do multiple meetings</em>, <em>reserve the entire timeslots on your
calendar</em>, <em>attend every session</em>, <em>do the preparation</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="social">
<h3>Social<a class="headerlink" href="#social" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Attend with someone!  Register together and try to be in their same
group.  This will create a network of learning and practice that will
last much longer.</p>
<p>If you can attend a group, that is even better.  You can bring your
own helper to guide you (if the workshop works this way).  Research
shows that groups that have multiple adopters have much more uptake of
new skills.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="workspace">
<h3>Workspace<a class="headerlink" href="#workspace" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Get a good, quiet workspace.  Make sure it is comfortable enough to
stay at for a while.</p>
<p>An extra monitor is useful but not required, since there is a lot of
stuff to follow: the stream itself, the lesson webpage, and the window
where you are doing the assignment.  You could also use a second
device to watch the stream (but if you do, see the
<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-zoom-mechanics"><span class="doc std std-doc">Zoom</span></a> page for info about screen sharing).</p>
<p>You’ll be expected to talk at some times and take part, not simply be
quiet and listen all the time.  Try to be in a place where you can
speak without disturbing others.  By the same token, you’ll be
listening for a long time, and your ears may get tired of headphones.
If you have good enough external speakers, be somewhere that you can
use them (perhaps only sometimes - when it doesn’t interfere with your
microphone.)</p>
<p>If you work in a large office, consider attending from home or in a
meeting room so that you can speak and listen more freely.  If you
need and extra monitor or more comfortable seating space and don’t
have that at home, consider working at your office.  Yes, these are
conflicting ideas, you need to find what works best for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="time-management">
<h3>Time management<a class="headerlink" href="#time-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Despite what most people think, attending things online can be harder
than in-person.</p>
<p>Don’t schedule overlapping meetings, reserve the entire timeslots,
minimze distractions.  It’s easy to think you can do multiple things
at once when doing it online, but really it’s a trap.</p>
<p>There will be breaks, but even long ones go by very fast, and this
gives you limited time to make coffee, eat, etc.  We try to limit
ourselves to half-days because of this, but consider preparing food,
coffee, etc. in advance.</p>
<p>Make sure you take the breaks, walk around some, etc.</p>
<p>Join the workshop stream 10 minutes early to get ready.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="software-installation">
<h3>Software installation<a class="headerlink" href="#software-installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Do the installation and configuration in advance, and double check
it.</strong>  In real workshops, problems here slow us down a lot, and if
you don’t prepare, you will immediately fall behind.  If there is a
pre-workshop session for installation, go there if needed.</p>
<p>If all else fails, join the workshop stream well in advance and ask
for help then.  Usually, there will be enough time to get ready for
the day.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="live-streaming">
<h3>Live streaming<a class="headerlink" href="#live-streaming" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you join by live streaming, things are a little bit more
complicated since you don’t go to breakout rooms.  But we think it is
still pretty good:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Take the workshop seriously anyway.</strong>  We take the streaming
experience seriously so that you can.  Reserve time, have a good
workspace, etc.  See “take the workshop seriously” above.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You can ask questions via the HackMD</strong>, which is the same way we
ask people to ask during the workshop.  If you register for Twitch,
you can use the <strong>Twitch chat</strong> for small comments, too.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Form a team anyway in your own meeting.</strong> You learn more from your
colleagues than you do from us, so take advantage.  Get one “helper”
for your team, start your own video call, watch the stream together,
and during the exercise times, work together.  We will be clear
about our timing, so that you can coordinate your team.  (Of course,
you can always follow individually)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Announcements and updates</strong>: Follow
<a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/coderefine">&#64;coderefine</a> on Twitter for news.</p></li>
<li><p>Come to an in-person workshop sometime: The stream is good, but
can’t replace the experience and individual help you get in person.

</div>
<div class="section" id="final-notes">
<h3>Final notes<a class="headerlink" href="#final-notes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Join the stream 10 minutes in advance.  There is some advance
icebreakers and discussion you can take part in, and you get to breath
before we start.</p>
<p>There is usually discussion after the workshop.  If you want, stick
around and give us immediate feedback and ask more questions.</p>

<p>In the <em>main room</em> during lectures, it is best to keep your microphone
muted in the main room unless you want to say something.  It’s OK to
unmute and speak up.</p>
<p>If you are in a quiet place, it’s best to stay unmuted in breakout
rooms and during active discussions.  This will make discussion much
smoother - a quiet environment or headset microphone helps with the
flow a lot.</p>

<p>Teaching isn’t about helping those who are already “in”, it is for those who aren’t.  Thus, we follow <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html">The Carpentries Code of Conduct</a> for all our interactions before, during and after workshops.</p>

<div class="section" id="creating-a-positive-learning-environment">
<h4>Creating a positive learning environment<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-positive-learning-environment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>As a helper, you have a crucial role during workshops:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Encourage learners to learn from each other.</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledge that some of the material can be difficult and that they will
learn more working together.</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledge when learners are confused and raise it to the instructors.
Understanding why learners are confused provides useful feedback for
instructors. You should be our eyes and ears.</p></li>
<li><p>As we said, you don’t have to know everything, just like learners don’t
necessarily know everything (we don’t know everything, either).  It’s more
important to be responsive and work together.</p></li>
<li><p>Stand up and walk around, try to make rounds by everyone.  If you are
convenient, students will ask.  If you are sitting in the back, student’s
wont.  Students rarely try to get your attention from across the room if you
don’t look ready.</p></li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="things-you-should-not-do-in-a-workshop">
<h4>Things you should not do in a workshop<a class="headerlink" href="#things-you-should-not-do-in-a-workshop" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Take over the learner’s keyboard. It is rarely a good idea to type anything
for your learners and it can be demotivating for the learner because it
implies you don’t think they can do it themselves or that you don’t want to
wait for them. It also wastes a valuable opportunity for them to develop muscle
memory and other skills that are essential for independent work.  Instead, try
to have a sticky note pad and pen and write the commands that they should type.</p></li>
<li><p>Criticize certain programs, operating systems, or GUI applications, or
learners who use them. (Excel, Windows, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool. Regardless of its
shortcomings, many of your learners may be using that tool. Convincing
someone to change their practices is much harder when they think you disdain
them.</p></li>
<li><p>Dive into complex or detailed technical discussion with the one or two people
in the audience who have advanced knowledge and may not actually need to be
at the workshop.</p></li>
<li><p>Pretend to know more than you do. People will actually trust you more if you
are frank about the limitations of your knowledge, and will be more likely to
ask questions and seek help.</p></li>
<li><p>Use “just”, “easy”, or other demotivating words. These signal to the learner
that the instructor thinks their problem is trivial and by extension that
they therefore must be stupid for not being able to figure it out.</p></li>
<li><p>Feign surprise at learners not knowing something. Saying things like “I can’t
believe you don’t know X” or “You’ve never heard of Y?” signals to the
learner that they do not have some required pre-knowledge of the material you
are teaching, that they don’t belong at the workshop, and it may prevent them
from asking questions in the future.</p></li>

<h2>Hints on breakout rooms, teams, and helping<a class="headerlink" href="#hints-on-breakout-rooms-teams-and-helping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This page is more targeted to online workshops, but could be relevant
to in-person too.</p>
<p>As a helper, you are what can make a breakout room / group work very
good or just normal.  This is a lot of responsibility and isn’t easy,
but it’s also not that complex: you aren’t expected to know
everything, but instead focus on the flow.  Our guidelines below
should make it doable for everyone.</p>
<p>Here, we give some hints on making the most of breakout rooms.  This
is especially targeted towards helpers.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A <strong>helper</strong> has basic knowledge and keeps one breakout room going.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>expert helper/instructor</strong> is someone who knows material well,
possibly an instructor.  They tend to move around helping different
groups.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="background-hierarchical-workshops-to-scale">
<h3>Background: hierarchical workshops to scale<a class="headerlink" href="#background-hierarchical-workshops-to-scale" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Traditionally, a workshops has instructors and helpers, but the
capacity is limited by instructors, so we are limited to ~30-40 people
at most.  Then, we tried to scale to larger numbers: even up to 100
people.  For this, we have to rely on <em>helpers</em> a lot more, to run a
breakout room.  A helper does not have to be an expert in the
material, but should be able to keep things flowing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="teams">
<h3>Teams<a class="headerlink" href="#teams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We try to arrange people in teams which stay together for all breakout
sessions on all days.  This allows people to form a bond and get the
rooms started sooner.  We will try to keep you in the same breakout
room as long as we can, but we give no promises and will rearrange as
needed when people can’t attend.</p>
<p>We sometimes allow people to register as teams: you bring learners and
a helper together, with the hope that you can keep working together
afterwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="general-in-the-main-session">
<h3>General, in the main session<a class="headerlink" href="#general-in-the-main-session" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As an instructor, you first need to decide how to balance between the
main room and breakout sessions.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Clearly say when a learner watches, when they type along, when they should
work on something independently as an exercise.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>You can try to plan the lesson so that more of it gets pushed to the
breakout session, and the main room is mostly discussion.  Since
each room has a helper, this works a bit better than in in-person
workshops</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This doesn’t work so well for all lessons.  Especially the more
basic lessons don’t work so well</p></li>
<li><p>It also requires some care, and you should probably hop from
room to room to monitor the progress.</p></li>

<h3>Preparing for the breakouts (in the main room)<a class="headerlink" href="#preparing-for-the-breakouts-in-the-main-room" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>As an instructor, you need to clearly define what the tasks of each
breakout session is (even if it is just “explore and discuss”).</strong>
Online courses need more <strong>“meta talk”</strong> about how you expect things
to go, since it’s not as easy to read the room or fill in expectations
later (distractions, hard to communicate to breakout rooms after
opened).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Clearly say what the tasks of the breakout session will be.</p></li>
<li><p>Put that task and a link to the part of the lesson in the hackmd.</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly say how long each breakout session will be (make sure it’s
long enough)</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly say if things in the future will depend on this exercise (is
someone completely lost if they don’t make it to the end.  Halfway?)</p></li>
<li><p>Try to make breakout sessions longer:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>imagine a 5 minute overhead for each session, getting people
there, deciding who does what, acquainted with what they need to
do, and debugging problems.</p></li>
<li><p>10 minutes is quite short, 20 minutes is best.</p></li>
<li><p>Can you say less and let people discover it for themselves?</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a helper, if anything is unclear to you, it is very unclear to
others. Speak up and ask!</p>

<span id="breakout-helpers"></span><h3>Helpers in breakout rooms<a class="headerlink" href="#helpers-in-breakout-rooms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As a breakout room helper, your main task is to <em>keep people talking
and interacting, understand their difficulties, and encourage them to
work on the exercises together.</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You can always start by greeting people and asking how the lesson is
going</p></li>
<li><p>Encourage people to turn on cameras</p></li>
<li><p>You can use chat within breakout rooms: Chat to “Everyone” in a
breakout room only means people in that room.</p></li>
<li><p>There are several strategies below.  Combine as needed - read the
room and see what they want, but do provide encouragement to do
something.</p></li>
<li><p>If you need extra help, write it in the HackMD, someone should be
watching it and relay it to the host.  Other helpers will try to
visit your rooms periodically, anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>Watch the time and try to keep things moving.  If some debugging
takes to long, it’s reasonable to ask for another helper who might
have seen the problem.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If any one problem takes too long, it’s OK to say “we don’t have
time, let’s come back”</p></li>
<li><p>Or, ask for an expert helper to come by and maybe answer
quickly, or break off to work on a solution.</p></li>

</div>
<p>There are several strategies you can use to run your breakout room:</p>
<p>Strategy 1:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Helpers ask someone to share the screen and go through the exercise.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>You can encourage the others to guide the one who is sharing the
screen. Or let the person go on her/his own pace.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I joke “The person who shares the screen has the easiest job,
since the rest of us guide you.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This might go against the CodeRefinery’s code of
conduct. The wording and the joking might cause some people
feel inferior. So, I recommend not to do so! Please others
comment about what they think about this.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Try to alternate who is sharing the screen for each session.</p></li>
<li><p>When someone has an issue, of course you switch screen share to them
and maybe even continue from there</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Strategy 2:</p>

<p>There’s not much difference between a helper and expert helper, but we
envision this role standing by and jumping into rooms when there’s a
difficult problem.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Sometimes, you wait around for a problem that needs your attention.
But it’s better to be proactive and go into the rooms yourself and
check them out.  Talk to the organizers/instructors to see which you
should do.</p></li>
<li><p>You aren’t assigned to particular breakout room, but <strong>you can
switch between them</strong> (but it’s not obvious how):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To do this, you <em>do</em> get assigned into one room initially.  Join
that room.  <em>After</em> you are in the room, click on “Breakout
Rooms”, and then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Join</span></code> to switch to a different room of your
choice.</p></li>
<li><p>You also always have the option “Leave breakout room” (if in a
room) or “Join your assigned room” (if in main room and assigned
one).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Your role is to switch between breakout rooms and check up on them.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>e.g. join room 1, take a look/ask how it is, then join room 2,
then 3, then back to 1, and repeat.</p></li>
<li><p>Of course, stay in one longer, if it’s needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a note of any important questions to be asked in the main
room afterwards.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Try to divide up the breakout rooms between the staff, and try to
join and catch up with the same rooms (this promotes familiarity).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>E.g. A rotates between rooms 1-3, B gets rooms 4-7, C gets rooms
8-11.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Make sure to watch the HackMD for helper requests</strong>, this could help
you decide which room to jump to next.  Comment when you are heading
there.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Concrete example for an expert helper’s time:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I join breakout room 5 randomly.  I spend 15 seconds watching, then
ask if things are going OK.  If everything is good, I move on within
a minute since I am not needed (if there is a good break, I’ll ask
“everything OK?  good, see you around.”).  If there are questions
that I can help with, I answer them.  If they seem to be struggling,
then I will make a note in the HackMD and stay a while longer and
watch/help.</p></li>

<h3>From helper to more<a class="headerlink" href="#from-helper-to-more" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Here is one possible pathway from learner to (whatever else).  This is
an <em>idea</em> for a pathway but by no means a requirement - you can join
at whatever step you like, and steps don’t have to happen in order.
Maybe you are interested in some or the other.  There are also roles
completely outside of this pathway.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>After being a learner, you come back as a helper.</p></li>
<li><p>When you have a solid understanding of all materials, you may join
as an expert helper.</p></li>
<li><p>You begin co-teaching episodes with someone else</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We find that co-teaching is a good way to start.  In this, there
are two people, one person assumes the big-picture discussion, and
the other the typing and explaining what they are doing.  By
making the lesson a discussion instead of a lecture, it’s more
dynamic.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Eventually, you get confident enough to teach yourself (though
really we should always be co-teaching…)</p></li>
<li><p>Somewhere in there (before or after instructor, depending on your
interests), you may want to try to be a HackMD helper or Zoom host.
These are more about coordinating all the other people involved in
the workshop.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s emphasize again: this is one pathway, but you should do what you
want.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="as-an-instructor">
<h3>As an instructor<a class="headerlink" href="#as-an-instructor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most of our workshops are very collaborative arrangements: you are
rarely alone.  This is one way of looking at it:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Look at and revise the workshops before they teach, making small,
incremental improvements.  But, you don’t have to (and in some
sense, it’s good if they stabilize some more).</p></li>
<li><p>Especially go over the examples when preparing.</p></li>
<li><p>Have a chat with someone else (probably another instructor or
experienced helper) before teaching.  We encourage this for
everyone, even experienced instructors, to better transfer knowledge
among each other and stay up to date with the latest developments.</p></li>
<li><p>Teach independently or co-teach.  Ideally, co-teach the first
time(s).  Really, we’d like to get to the point where we <em>always</em>
co-teach.  Co-teaching doesn’t mean different people take different
lessons, but two people teach all parts of the same lesson by
turning it into a discussion between the two instructors.  TODO:
produce information on this.</p></li>

<h3>Top issues new instructors face<a class="headerlink" href="#top-issues-new-instructors-face" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Breaks are not negotiable, minimum 10 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Breakout sessions too short.  Make them as long as possible, don’t
expect to come back for new intro, then go back.</p></li>
<li><p>People will accomplish less than you expect.  Expect learners to be 5
times slower than you, at best!</p></li>
<li><p>All the other tools and stuff will go wrong.  Try to not bring in a
dependency when you don’t need it.</p></li>
<li><p>Trying to accomplish too much: it’s OK to cut out and adapt to the
audience.  Have a reserve session at the end you prepare, but are
ready to skip.</p></li>
<li><p>Explaining how, but not why.</p></li>
<li><p>Running out of time to making your environment match the
learner’s.</p></li>
<li><p>Running out of time to set up good screen sharing practices
(terminal history, portion of screen, remote history) in advance.</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming learners remember what they have already learned, or know
the prerequisites.  Or have stuff installed and configured.</p></li>
<li><p>Not managing expectations: learners think that you will accomplish
everything, and feel sad when you don’t.</p></li>

<li><p>Ensure people are asking questions at the bottom, direct them there
if they aren’t.</p></li>

should be a bullet point below.</p>

<li><p>Should you use more deeply nested bullet points, or have only one
level below the initial question?  It depends on the context, but
if a conversation goes on too long, try not to let it go too
deep.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Update with meta-talk, so that learners can follow along easily:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Add Icebreaker and introductory material of the day.  Try to talk to
people as they joined to get them to open HackMD and answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Anything important for following along should not be only said via
voice.  It needs to be in the HackMD, too.</p></li>
<li><p>New lessons or episodes, with links to them.</p></li>
<li><p>For exercises, link to exercise and add the duration, end time,
goals.  If these are unclear, bring it up to the instructor by voice.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a status display about breaks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Screenshare it when necessary:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>During breaks and other times, share the HackMD (including the
notification about break, and when it ends).</p></li>
<li><p>It is nice if the arrangement allows some of the latest questions to
be seen, so people are reminded to ask there.</p></li>
<li><p>Someone else may do this, but should make sure it happens.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Answer questions</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If there is an question that should be answered by the instructor by
voice, bring it up (by voice) to the instructor immediately.</p></li>
<li><p>During breakout sessions, watch for HackMD notifications about
breakout rooms that need help
and direct someone to that room.</p></li>
<li><p>How soon do you answer questions? Two points of view:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Answer questions right away: can be really intense to follow.</p></li>
<li><p>Wait some so that we don’t overload learners: reduces the info
flow.  But then do people need to check back more often.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to find your own balance.  Maybe a quick answer right
away, and more detailed later.  Or delay answers during the most
important parts of the lecture.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Be careful that you don’t give too long and involved answers, which
take up too much mental energy from learners while they are
learning.  It’s a balance you should think about on your own.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Here, it is useful to have multiple short followups in bullet
points, each going a bit more in detail.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ensure it can be posted quickly:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>HackMD gets posted to the workshop webpage.  For this, it needs some
minimal amount of formatting (it doesn’t need to be perfect, just
not horrible).</p></li>
<li><p>All names and private information needs to be stripped.  This is why
you should rigorously tag all names with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[name=XXX]</span></code> so they can be
removed (see above).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Learner names can be completely removed.  CR staff names can be
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[name=CR]</span></code> or something similar.</p></li>
<li><p>There may be other private URLs at the top or bottom.</p></li>

Encourage helpers to stand and be

solution). They can also be used for voting, e.g. red/green for two
answers of a multiple choice question.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t touch the learner’s keyboard!  This is very hard to do, since
it’s only natural to want to get things done quickly.  The best idea
we have is to have a pen and sticky notes, when it’s hard to spell
out a command to type, write it instead.</p></li>
<li><p>If appropriate for your topic, create a cumulative
cheatsheet/diagram on the board as you are presenting.</p></li>
<li><p>Take advantage of the mistakes/typos you make when teaching!
When you do a mistake and get an error message and realize what you did wrong,
explain what happened since this can offer valuable insights to learners.</p></li>

<li><p>Try not to completely deviate from the material. Ideally, rather influence the material before you teach.
Of course it is good to react to questions and to adapt the material to the audience, so sometimes an excursion can be very useful,
but make clear that you then deviate from the script
and be explicit about whether participants should follow what you do or only watch.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to show some extra steps in the terminal, show them perhaps at the end of an exercise block to not
“mess up” the exercise half-way and change it with respect to the material.</p></li>

<h3>Screen sharing<a class="headerlink" href="#screen-sharing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You have to assume the smallest screen from learners and plan for that.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Learners have a small screen, and need room for their own terminals
and web browser open, too.  A big screen or multiple monitors is
special.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure the text is more than large enough - people are not just
reading, but struggling to find the important parts while the.</p></li>
<li><p>Sharing a 1920x1080 screen is not a good idea: you need to make all
the text size large so that learners can scale it down, but pixels
are wasted.</p></li>
<li><p>Sharing a single window would be good, but usually you need more
than one.</p></li>
<li><p>Zoom now has a “share portion of screen” (Screen sharing → Advanced
→ Share a portion of the screen).</p></li>
<li><p>Our latest idea is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Share a vertical part of the screen, for example half of your
screen.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a FullHD 1920x1080 screen, maybe even a smaller
portion than that.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When streaming/recording: <strong>Never stop sharing a screen, ask someone
else to take it over</strong>.
There is a chance that the view goes to “gallery view” in the
recording or stream, which makes video editing harder or disrupts
learner privacy.</p>

<h4>Terminal history for learners<a class="headerlink" href="#terminal-history-for-learners" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

all interleaved, which makes it hard to follow what you actually
typed.  Have a separate window that shows recent commands only,
without output.  Arrange your screen so there is the main window and
the smaller “history” window.  The history window runs the tail
commands and can be used as a reference for what you just did.</p>
<p>Also check the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Sabryr/Teaching-aids">shell exporter by

<h2>Summary of Teaching Tech Together<a class="headerlink" href="#summary-of-teaching-tech-together" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://teachtogether.tech/">Teaching Tech Together</a> is a book
compiled by Greg Wilson which is about the pedagogy and practical
hints of teaching technology in informal environments.  It is a very
good resource, and the main point is that research does back up
teaching, it’s not all intuition.  Many citations are included.</p>
<p>This page contains a summary of the most important points.  The point
is that one can quickly refer to this before writing a new lesson or
teaching a course.  The article <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006915">Ten quick tips for creating an
effective lesson</a> is
also a good summary of the main lesson design points of this book.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Backwards lesson design, similar to test-driven development: 1)
brainstorm ideas for what to cover, 2) create learner personas to
figure out who you want to teach, 3) create formative assessments to
give learners a chance to exercise what they are trying to learn
(3-4 per hour), 4) put formative exercises in order, 5) write the
teaching material around this.</p></li>
<li><p>Learner persons, to guide your design process: a) general
background, b) what they already know, c) what they <em>think</em> they
want to know, d) how course will help, e) special needs.</p></li>
<li><p>Learning objectives: write objectives and think of what depth of
understanding you are getting too.  Consider Bloom’s taxonomy: a)
remember, b) understand, c) apply, d) analyze, e) evaluate, f)
create.</p></li>
<li><p>Fink’s taxonomy (unlike Bloom’s, complimentary not hierarchical): a)
foundational knowledge, b) application, c) integration, d) human
dimension, e) caring, f) learning how to learn.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintainability: is it easier to update than replace?  a) <strong>You have to
document the lesson design process</strong>, b) technical collaboration, c)
are people willing to collaborate?  Or do teachers resample rather

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Get feedback on your teaching.  People aren’t born teachers, and
feedback isn’t in the western teaching culture enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Use live coding.  It’s much more effective, especially because it’s
two way and <em>you can demonstrate making mistakes</em>.  a) embrace your
mistakes, b) ask for predictions, c) take it slow, d) be seen and
heard (stand + microphone), e) mirror your learner’s environment, f)
use the screen wisely (make it big enough), g) double devices (one
to present, one for notes), h) use diagrams, i) avoid distractions,
j) improvise after you know the material, k) face the screen only
occasionally</p></li>

it’s for those that aren’t.  If you don’t notice problems and
enforce it transparently, it means nothing though.</p></li>
<li><p>Peer instruction.  Discuss in groups.  e.g. multiple choice
question, if there is a wide variety of wrong answers, have them
discuss in groups.</p></li>
<li><p>Teach teaching: different strategies, consider what you want to do:
a) teach teaching (taking turns) b) teach and assist (going around
helping) c) alternative teaching (group with more specialized
instruction), d) teacher and observer, e) parallel teaching (two
groups, same material), f) station teaching (rotate through
stations).</p></li>
<li><p>If co-teaching, plan ahead: a) confirm roles at start, b) work out
some hand signals for common conditions, c) each person should talk
at least 10-15 min at a time, d) person who isn’t teaching shouldn’t
distract, though leading questions OK, e) check what your partner
will teach after you are done, f) inactive teacher stays engaged,
not doing own stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>Plan for mixed abilities, especially false beginners who have
studied the material before.</p></li>
<li><p>Can you make a collaborative not online document?</p></li>

<li><p>Extrinsic vs intrinsic motivation.  Extrinsic: have to do it for job
or something.  Intrinsic: do it for self, you want to encourage
intrinsic motivation.  Drivers of intrinsic motivation: a)
competence, b) autonomy, c) relatedness (connection to others).</p></li>
<li><p>Consider usefulness and time to master.  Focus on useful and fast.
Useful = <em>authentic tasks</em>, things people will actually use.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid demotivation: for adults, a) unpredictability, b)
indifference, c) unfairness.  Specific examples: a) contemptuous
attitude, b) saying existing skills are worthless, c) complex or
detailed technical discussion, d) pretending you know more than
they do, e) the word “just” as in, it’s “just easy”, f) software
installation problems, g) giving impossible challenges to fail at to
try to learn something, if not understanding.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="lecture-room">
<h3>Lecture room<a class="headerlink" href="#lecture-room" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The room needs to be sufficiently large (a typical workshop is attended by
around 20 learners and 4 instructors).</p></li>
<li><p>There needs to be enough space for instructors to walk around and interact
with learners individually (a “flat” room is required).</p></li>
<li><p>Learners should face the same direction, and learners should be able to sit
side-by-side for pairwise work.</p></li>
<li><p>The room should preferably have windows, and be ventilated well enough so
that 20-30 people (and same amount of laptops) will not make it too warm.</p></li>
<li><p>A coffee room (or similar) should be located nearby for the coffee breaks.</p></li>
<li><p>Two overhead projectors are desirable, but if only one is available that will

<h3>Helpers<a class="headerlink" href="#helpers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>CodeRefinery workshops are hands-on and interactive, and a lot of time is
spent on exercises where participants learn by doing.  Participants
explore themselves, and that means they need guides to help them if
they get stuck.</p>
<p>We recommend that each site takes proactive steps to recruit at least
two helpers per workshop.  We’ve noticed that helper diversity
promotes learning, so we recommend that organizers also make proactive
steps to have diverse helpers (male/female, international, etc.).
Local organizers should directly contact possible helpers and invite them.</p>
<p>Good candidates are people who have any of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>have attended a previous CodeRefinery workshop</p></li>
<li><p>have a passion for teaching, scientific software development, open

<p>Dear Professor X,</p>
<p>My name is NAME and I work as a XXX in YYY. I’m contacting you now to spread the word about a workshop which I am co-organizing in LOCATION together with the CodeRefinery project (http://coderefinery.org/) organized under the NeIC organization. I found your contact information via ZZZ…</p>
<p>CodeRefinery (http://coderefinery.org) aims to reach out to diverse academic communities which use and develop software in their research, and advocate more modern and efficient software development methods (such as collaborative distributed version control, automated testing, code documentation, managing code complexity, etc). CodeRefinery is not about efficient code, but rather efficient coding, and experience has shown that researchers have a lot to gain from our course material!</p>
<p>A CodeRefinery workshop is planned for LOCATION in CITY on DATE, see the website here: URL</p>
<p>The most natural audience for our workshops is PhD students and postdocs, but both more junior and senior people may find it valuable to attend.</p>

9:00-12:00

Engage in the successful CodeRefinery workshop program, by becoming a tutor for
the exercise sessions and discussion groups.  If you have been to a
CodeRefinery workshop, you will have experienced  a very hands-on approach to
training with frequent exercise sessions and group discussions.  In online
workshops these sessions take place in breakout rooms with 5-7 participants and
1-2 workshop tutors.  Tutors answer questions from the learners, guide them
through the exercises and try to keep time.  If needed, tutors can call on
experienced trainers in the background to help answer tricky questions.  The
tutors are an important part of the CodeRefinery teaching concept and all the
workshops to scale to many more people than the instructors could  otherwise
manage!

If you have previously attended a CodeRefinery workshop, and/or use some of the
tools and methods covered in a workshop (Git, software testing, modern
documentation platforms etc.), then please consider joining a CodeRefinery
workshop as a tutor! Being a tutor is fun, it expands your network and develops
your teaching and mentoring skills.  You always learn something new about a
subject by teaching it!

If you would like to help on the upcoming workshop in November, please sign up
as a tutor on https://coderefinery.github.io/2020-11-17-online/.  If you would
like to engage in later workshops, please register as a tutor on the notify-me

Dear CodeRefinery alumnus,

We hope that you enjoyed participating in a CodeRefinery workshop last semester and that it was 
beneficial for your work and research! We don’t keep an attendance list, so apologies to those 
of you who couldn&#39;t make it to the workshop...

Please help us to improve our course material and teaching methods by answering our very brief questionnaire at 
https://indico.neic.no/event/109/
about whether and how the CodeRefinery workshop affected how you develop code. 
All information you provide will be useful. Your participation is extremely valuable 
and will help us to develop the project further. The average time to fill the form is around 5 minutes.

Would you be interested in being a helper or instructor in future workshops? It&#39;s a great way to continue 
developing your skills and expanding your network! We&#39;re always interested in recruiting new helpers 
and instructors. If this sounds interesting to you, please get in touch by writing to 
support@coderefinery.org or join our chat: https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com

<h4>Practical info (online)<a class="headerlink" href="#practical-info-online" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>The online CodeRefinery workshop TITLE is approaching! It will take place on DATE at START - END in Zoom room ZOOMID.
On the first day, we also have an optional session starting half an hour before START where you can connect,
test your video client and iron out any technical issues (we recommend attending this if you haven’t used Zoom before).</p>
<p>If it turns out that you cannot attend, please let us know as soon as possible so that we can offer your seat to someone on the waiting list.</p>
<p>We will be using a Zoom room with ID ZOOMID. We recommend that you install the Zoom client (https://zoom.us/download).
In order to join the room you will need the password ZOOMPASSWORD.
You will be encouraged (but not forced) to use a webcam during the workshop.
If you don’t want the physical room you’re in to be visible on the webcam, Zoom allows users to set up a virtual background:
https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/210707503-Virtual-Background
You might also be asked to share your screen during group exercises or in interactions with a workshop helper.
Remember to keep private information away from the screen you share!</p>
<p>You are expected to install some software on your computers before the workshop starts.
Please visit the workshop webpage WORKSHOPURL and go through each tool under “Software requirements”,
and install whatever you’re missing before the workshop starts. Note that you also need to create some accounts.
Note that each of these tools/accounts can easily be removed/deactivated after the workshop, if you so wish (see https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/accounts/).</p>
<p>Don’t hesitate to get in touch (support&#64;coderefinery.org) if you run into any installation problems or have questions relating
to Zoom or other practical details. Note that we maintain a list of common installation issues that can occur at https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/troubleshooting/</p>
<p>If you haven’t already filled the pre-workshop survey, please do that soon since it helps us with workshop preparation.
You can find it at: SURVEYURL.</p>
<p>The workshop will be very focused on version control with Git. Some of you are already familiar with Git, but not all.
While we will be starting from the basics, we will be progressing quickly so it’s useful if you spend a few minutes to read up on the basic idea of Git.
For this purpose, we have prepared this “refresher” material: https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/
Note that this material also contains important Git configuration steps which all of you should go through before the workshop starts, to save valuable time during the workshop.</p>
<p>CodeRefinery strives to follow the Code of Conduct developed by The Carpentries organisation. Please have a look at
https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html so that we all are aware of how to treat each other respectfully.</p>
<p>Don’t hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions!</p>
<p>Best,
MYNAME</p>

<h4>Practical info, in-person<a class="headerlink" href="#practical-info-in-person" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>The CodeRefinery CITY workshop on DATE is approaching! The location and schedule
is available on the workshop webpage: URL</p>
<p>If it turns out that you cannot attend, please let us know as soon as possible
so that we can offer your seat to someone on the waiting list.</p>
<p>You are expected to install some software on your laptops before the workshop
starts. Please visit the workshop webpage (URL) and go through each tool under
“Software requirements”, and install whatever you’re missing before the workshop
starts. Note that you also need a couple of accounts (GitHub and Read the Docs).
Note that each of these tools/accounts can easily be removed/deactivated after
the workshop, if you so wish (see https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/accounts/).</p>
<p>Don’t hesitate to get in touch (support&#64;coderefinery.org) if you run into any

<p>The workshop will have a strong focus on version control with Git. Some of you
are already somewhat familiar with Git, but not all. While we will be starting
from the basics, we will be progressing quickly so it’s useful if you spend
10-20 minutes to read up on the basic idea of Git. For this purpose, we have
prepared this “refresher” material:
https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/</p>
<p>Please have a look at this material before the workshop starts. Note that it

<h3>Recording of sessions<a class="headerlink" href="#recording-of-sessions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you plan on recording and publishing the session, prepare in advance so that
you don’t have a difficult editing job later.
Make sure that you (or users) don’t show any personal or confidential information.
Think about what happens if users speak: do you ask for permission to publish
in advance (maybe encouraging people not to), or edit it out later (taking
your time later).</p>
<p>If you plan to record the session, make sure that everybody is aware that the
sessions is recorded, informed about how the recording will be used, and gives
consent to be recorded:
<a class="reference external" href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360026909191-Consent-to-be-Recorded">https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360026909191-Consent-to-be-Recorded</a></p>
<p>In Zoom it’s important to start recording in the form you want the video to be
in (e.g. start recording when screen is shared so that it stays there):

To complete your registration, you need to:

1) Enter your registration details by clicking the &quot;Apply now&quot; button below.
2) Fill in the pre-workshop survey by clicking the &quot;Fill out the survey&quot; button below.

Confirmation email
After filling out the registration form you will receive an automatic confirmation email but please note that your registration is only tentative until we confirm it with another (human-written) email which should happen typically within a week.

Waiting list
We maintain a waiting list for seats but this is currently not automatic so we need this short time buffer to manually confirm participants and inform those who are on the waiting list.

First come, first serve
The seats are assigned on a first come first serve basis but we need to also make sure that registered participants are affiliated with a Nordic academic institution since the course is free for participants and financed by the Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (unless this is an event outside of Nordics funded by a different organization).

Cancellation
We ask confirmed participants who are not able to participate at the course they have signed up for, to inform us as soon as possible so that people on the waiting list can take the vacant seat.

Questions?
If you have any questions about your registration status, please write to support@coderefinery.org.

Looking forward to seeing you at the workshop!

<h2>Video editing<a class="headerlink" href="#video-editing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this page is to give video processing volunteers a
starting point.  (It also has some hints for workshop organizers).</p>
<p>For some of our online lessons, we release videos on YouTube.  This is
not necessarily for brand new people to watch and learn the material
(though they may), but especially for people who attended the workshop
to review what they saw.  As such, it’s more important to get them
published fast, than make them perfect.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-want">
<h3>What we want<a class="headerlink" href="#what-we-want" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Our workshops consist of lectures, demo, and exercises in breakout
rooms.  We record the main Zoom room, and also livestream the main
room via Twitch.  We would like the video of the workshop to be
processed so that it can be released on YouTube.  This should not be a
major production: it is more useful to those who want to review what
they saw in person, rather than a new person watching.</p>
<p>We will provide the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Raw video files (probably two copies one recorded from Zoom and one
from Twitch - so there is a backup.)</p></li>
<li><p>List of lessons (= final videos) and which raw files contain them
and when.</p></li>
<li><p>List of instructors</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We want out:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>One processed video file per lesson.</p></li>
<li><p>With irrelevant breaks removed.</p></li>
<li><p>Without any video from learners.  We use Zoom so that learners
should not appear in the stream, but we can’t be sure it works so
this needs to be checked.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The rough process is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Load up the right video files in the editor.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the start of the lesson (hint: look for a change of
instructor - ask us if you need help!) and cut off the stuff before.</p></li>
<li><p>Watch through the videos.  Most of the lecture parts are fairly
standard and can be fast-forwarded through (it’s rare for a
learner’s picture to appear here).</p></li>
<li><p>Cut out the idle time during breaks.</p></li>
<li><p>In exercise sessions, learners go to breakout rooms, which are not
recorded.  This part can be cut out, <em>but</em> sometimes the instructor
stays in the main room to do the exercises for the stream.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t be too precise.  We aren’t trying to make a masterpiece to end
all masterpieces, but a something for those who were at the workshop
to refer back to.  So:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Imprecise start/stop/break times are fine</p></li>
<li><p>Other random off-topic chat is fine</p></li>
<li><p>Voices of learners is fine and expected</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Video</strong> of learners is <strong>not ok</strong> (really, this is the only
thing that needs care).</p></li>

<h3>Processing<a class="headerlink" href="#processing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Processing principles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Remove any participant videos, if they accidentally make it into
the video file</strong>.  This is really the only serious rule in the
processing, if we didn’t have to check this we could just upload the
raw ones and it would be good enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Create one final video per lesson in the workshop</p></li>
<li><p>Work incrementally, upload processed ones when you can, get quick
feedback.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If it’s not clear, the course organizers will provide a list of the
lessons (final outputs) and the respective inputs (which source files
go into it).</p>
<p>You can generally:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use some video editor</p>
<ul>
<li><p>iMovie on Mac</p></li>
<li><p>OpenShot is a simple cross-platform editor (<a class="reference external" href="https://cdn.openshot.org/static/files/user-guide/quick_tutorial.html">tutorial</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>(please give more ideas here)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>(so far, this is not a general “how to edit video” guide… you will
need to find one for your editing program)</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new project for the output (e.g. the Jupyter lesson)</p></li>
<li><p>Import the raw video files which contain Jupyter (e.g. day 4).  If
one lesson is split over multiple files, combine them.</p></li>
<li><p>Cut off the part before and after the lesson itself (saving
frequently).  You’ll have to figure out the start and end times,
this may be hard when there are several files.</p></li>
<li><p>Begin watching the lesson.  Look for the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Break time?  Exercise session with irrelevant stuff in the video?
Cut the time out.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Any non-instructors pictures in the stream?</strong>  Cut it out.
Sometimes you might need to blank the picture while</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t be too perfectionist - the goal is to get something done,
not maek the perfect videos.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Export the videos with a high quality, e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">jupyter.mp4</span></code>.  It
will go to YouTube which will render lower resolutions, so you don’t
need to worry about this so much.</p></li>
<li><p>Upload the videos to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">processed</span></code> subdirectory of the google
drive.  Do this immediately, video by video.  It’s better to get
continuous feedback on this.  You are done!</p></li>

options).</p>

<h2>Lesson design<a class="headerlink" href="#lesson-design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is a checklist and hints when writing and designing a new lesson.
The master material is in Teaching Tech Together, primarily chapters 6
and 12 for practicalities and 2 and 4 for big picture considerations.
But really, all the book.  See <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-teaching-tech-together"><span class="doc std std-doc">the summary we
made</span></a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://teachtogether.tech/">the actual
book</a>.  The article <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006915">Ten quick tips for creating an
effective lesson</a> is
also a good summary of the main points.
Finally, the <a class="reference external" href="https://cdh.carpentries.org/">Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook</a> gives practical information on how to design a new lesson and covers the entire lesson life-cycle with a good overview of the lesson release timeline.</p>
<p>This doesn’t replace your own knowledge in doing the actual teaching
part.  Instead, the first half gives pointers on making sure your
audience can connect to the material, and the last half gives hints
to help you come up with good exercises and examples.</p>
<div class="section" id="backwards-lesson-design">
<h3>Backwards lesson design<a class="headerlink" href="#backwards-lesson-design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Think test-driven development: decide what you want students to be able
to do, design exercises to measure it, then fill in the gaps with
teaching.  You can see <a class="reference external" href="http://teachtogether.tech/en/template/">their
summary</a>.  The steps are:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Brainstorm what you want to cover.</p></li>
<li><p>Create or reuse learner personas - understand who you want to
teach.  What do they care about?  Perhaps as important is what they
don’t care about: make sure that you don’t go too in depth too
early and turn people off.</p></li>
<li><p>Create some summative assessments, that show what learners should
learn by the end.  Try to connect these to the learner personas.</p></li>
<li><p>Create formative assessments (exercises) that let the learners
practice what you want them to learn.  See below for hints on coming
up with good exercises.  These should also connect to things the
learners will actually do, but can also be more of checkpoints.</p></li>
<li><p>Put exercises in a logical order, and fill in any gaps.  Ideally
there should be 15-20 min of teaching between each exercise.  Perhaps
most are short (a few longer examples as needed), to identify a
certain learning goal and misconception.</p></li>
<li><p>Write just enough material to get from one exercise to the other.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The most important point here is to start from learner’s needs and how
they can feel connected, not from the tech details.</p>
<p>When advertising the course, connect it to your learner personas so
that you get the right audience and they know why they should come.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="emotional-and-intrinsic-appeal-other-basics">
<h3>Emotional and intrinsic appeal, other basics<a class="headerlink" href="#emotional-and-intrinsic-appeal-other-basics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You can think of why people should feel emotionally connected to your
material - maybe it’s too much to expect people to get emotionally
invested, but if you try for that, you’ll end somewhere better.</p>
<p>Try to design around tasks and exercises which your audience will care
about.  For example, don’t say “here are some shell commands”, but
“aren’t you tired of copying all of these files one by one… check
out the shell… once you know it, you will really feel at home.  Here
are some typical things you might do.”.  Intrinsic motivators include
<strong>sense of agency</strong> (being able to do things themselves), <strong>competence</strong>
(usefulness of what they are doing, feeling they know something), and
<strong>relatedness</strong> (doing things that others are doing).</p>
<p>A manual is reference, a tutorial builds a cognitive model.  If you
can build the cognitive model and tell them the “why”, students may be
able to refer to the manuals themselves and become self-sufficient.
Thus, teaching should be more of a
tutorial, with good links to manuals (it can also explicitly teach
how to use the manuals).</p>
<p>Perhaps a related point is inclusiveness: make sure there’s not some
“in” crowd.  Perhaps the best description I have seen: don’t assume
that some people are missing something, but that others have had the
fortune of learning it earlier.  This may not matter in a purely
factual lesson design, but if you are trying to make things
intrinsically or emotionally appealing, it is essential.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="who-is-the-audience">
<h3>Who is the audience?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-is-the-audience" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Making the <strong>learner personas</strong> are essential to making a good lesson,
even if you think you know who you are teaching to.  This is because
it grounds you into what your audience already knows (or doesn’t know)
and what they are interested in.</p>
<p>You also have different ways people can refer to the material:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In a class, with an instructor guiding them</p></li>
<li><p>Reading along by themselves</p></li>
<li><p>In a class, being much more advanced than others, so that they skip
ahead and do advanced material themselves.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="planning">
<h3>Planning<a class="headerlink" href="#planning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do some planning, and <em>document it</em> - the design process helps
others to teach and modify.  At least put it in the README.  (this
is the <strong>designer/maintainer’s guide</strong>)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Put the main points from the “backwards lesson design process” in
here, enough that it is easier for someone to improve your lesson
than to redo it.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Make learner personas: what is your target audience?</p></li>
<li><p>Decide learning objectives based on the personas: high-level end
goals.  What students get out, not what they do.</p></li>
<li><p>Also make a <em>guide</em> for teaching (<strong>instructor’s guide</strong>), “if you
want to present this, do this”.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How much preparation is needed?  Is it enough to know the topic
and have read the material?</p></li>
<li><p>Things to prepare before the presentation.  Does anything need to
be set up?</p></li>
<li><p>Practical notes on presenting.</p></li>
<li><p>Are there solutions to exercises somewhere?  Are they needed?</p></li>
<li><p>Include some pre-assessment questions which can be asked at the
beginning.</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps you should do this at the end, but at least starting the
instructor’s guide at the beginning will frame your writing.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="writing">
<h3>Writing<a class="headerlink" href="#writing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There is not much here yet, mostly just follow the “backwards lesson design”
above.  The hardest part is coming up with good exercises, so our
practical advice is to mix and match from the two taxonomies at the
bottom and the exercise types.  Try to think of diverse types of
exercises.</p>
<p>Exercise design is the time it is most useful to be with others to do
brainstorming, so we highly recommend discussing with others at this
point.  Because exercises are used to set the overall outline of the
lesson, this also gives people a say in the overall outline - in a
very concrete way.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Make sure you include the emotional starting point at the beginning - why
should you care and why is this cool?</p></li>
<li><p>This should also be at the start and end of each section: not just what
or how, but why?</p></li>
<li><p>Part of this is also having a <strong>student’s guide</strong>, so that
people independently studying can know how to follow the material.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s OK to have more material than can be presented or than people
should know, but <em>label things well</em>, including <em>labeling the difficulty</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the beginning, what sections are expected to be taught in
short/long versions?  What’s advanced/optional?</p></li>
<li><p>Label advanced and optional sections as such.  Perhaps also really
basic sections that can be skipped for that reason.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Plan for mixed abilities.  It’s OK to have optional (basic) and
advanced sections, as long as they are clearly labeled.  Mainly, don’t
have people think that you are uncoordinated because you are skipping
advanced sections.</p>
<p>Once you are done, update maintainer’s and instructor’s guides.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introduction-and-conclusion">
<h3>Introduction (and conclusion)<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-and-conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The introduction is the first thing people hear, and needs special
thought.  Don’t start with a cold open, just going straight to the
topic (“what” or “how”).  Instead, have some careful motivation
(“why”).  It could be especially good to talk about what is wrong with
the current state of affairs (give a good, simple example) and why it
should be improved.  Then start talking about what the improvements
are.</p>
<p>Ideally, the introduction should serve as an self-contained abstract
of your material.  If you need to teach your lesson in only 10% of the
time you have, can you use just the introduction to do it?</p>
<p>Conclusion should remind people about why this is cool and discuss
what comes next.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="thinking-of-exercises">
<h3>Thinking of exercises<a class="headerlink" href="#thinking-of-exercises" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Not every exercise has to be an amazing hand-on example.  It’s mixing
with smaller, more conceptual things to reduce the cognitive load and
be able to have more frequent exercises.</p>
<p>One of your other primary goals should be to make your exercises
<em>relevant</em>.  Abstract will lead to disconnection. Connect the exercises
to the real world.  Also, can you tell a complete story with
exercises?  (Remember, in backwards lesson design, the exercises
form the story of the lesson.)</p>
<p>Remember that not every exercise has to be long.  Try to have
frequent short exercises to get immediate feedback, with some long
ones.</p>
<p>Good exercises are the most important factor in a good lesson.  Even
if you are preparing the rest of the lesson mostly alone, consider a
good long brainstorming session to go from “list of topics to cover”
to “sequence of exercises”.</p>
<p>When you are stuck thinking “how can I make an exercise that covers
X”, think of the lists below inspiration.  Not every exercise has to be an
sophisticated hands-on thing, so don’t be afraid to use different
types:</p>
<p>Basic types:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Multiple choice (easy to get feedback via a classroom tool - try to
design each wrong answer so that it identifies a specific
misconception).</p></li>
<li><p>Code yourself (traditional programming)</p></li>
<li><p>Code yourself + multiple choice to see what the answer is (allows
you to get feedback)</p></li>
<li><p>Inverted coding (given code, have to debug)</p></li>
<li><p>Parsons problems (working solution but lines in random order,
learner must only put in proper order)</p></li>
<li><p>Fill in the blank</p></li>
</ul>
<p>More advanced:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Tracing execution</p></li>
<li><p>Tracing values through code flow (e.g. what is the sequence of
values that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span></code> takes on?)</p></li>
<li><p>Reverse execution (find input that gives an output)</p></li>
<li><p>Minimal fix (given broken code, make it work)</p></li>
<li><p>Theme and variations (working code, adapt to other type of
situation/problem)</p></li>
<li><p>Refactoring</p></li>
</ul>
<p>More conceptual:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Draw a diagram</p></li>
<li><p>Label diagram</p></li>
<li><p>Matching problem: two sets of Q/A, match them.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thinking through the learning taxonomies also helps to come up with
diverse types of exercises:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Bloom’s taxonomy: hierarchical skill levels (can you help students
to “grow a level”?):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remembering</p></li>
<li><p>Understanding</p></li>
<li><p>Applying</p></li>
<li><p>Analyzing</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluating</p></li>
<li><p>Creating</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Fink’s taxonomy: complementary types instead of hierarchical:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Foundational knowledge</p></li>
<li><p>Applications</p></li>
<li><p>Integration</p></li>
<li><p>Human dimension</p></li>
<li><p>Caring</p></li>
<li><p>Learning how to learn</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Remember to keep the <em>story</em> of the lesson in mind.  Many people are

<h3>Major Refactorings<a class="headerlink" href="#major-refactorings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Always start with the big picture: does it make sense?  When
refactoring, always start off with backwards lesson design again (see
lesson-design.md) and fully go through that.</p>
<p>After the above, do the details.  Remember the guides still.</p>
<p>Before you start major refactoring and rewriting, think if it makes
sense.  Have you figured out why it’s the way it is based on the
instructor’s guide?  If you do a big refactoring, make sure you update
the maintainer’s guide!</p>
<p>Before you embark on a big refactoring step, please pitch your idea
in a GitHub issue and collect feedback from others.  Maybe even hold a
brainstorming session.</p>

support roles and our CodeRefinery mindset partially overlaps, we have
some brief guidelines here.</p>
<p>There is far too much professional information for us to reproduce

<p>“A good tutorial is different from a good reference.  Very few things
are good at both at the same time.” - (I don’t remember who, seen in
Teaching Tech Together).  Thus, both tutorials and reference are
useful.  Sometimes, we need a tutorial for our stuff and can point to
outside material as a reference.  People also really want examples
they can copy - is your infra similar enough that outside examples can
be copied?</p>

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com">CodeRefinery zulipchat</a> is
where our primary discussion, planning, and action takes place.  Many
things are announced only via zulipchat.  This is a public chat and
everybody is welcome to join, no invitation needed, and we explicitly
invite anyone to give ideas in any thread.</p>
<p>The chat is a joint community of CodeRefinery (teaching), NordicHPC
(infrastructure), and Nordic-RSE (usage and software), which are other
Nordic projects about scientific computing which share some of the
same people.  Together, we have a network of all aspects of modern
scientific computing.</p>
<p>Unlike Slack, zulipchat is very heavily threaded, and it is easy to
follow along without being active all the time.  Respond within the
topic (=thread) that is relevant, or make a new thread.  Sometimes you
can find old threads to revive.  Don’t worry, everything is flexible
and you’ll quickly learn by watching (and don’t worry about going
wrong).</p>
<div class="section" id="streams">
<h3>Streams<a class="headerlink" href="#streams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once you join the chat, you will be subscribed to some default
streams (a stream is basically a channel).  <strong>The first thing you
should do is join some more streams, depending on your interest.  Join
more streams by clicking gear icon by the steams list on the left side
on that chat, then selecting what you are interested in.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Gear icon to join a stream" src="_images/chat--join-stream.png" /></p>
<p>If you <strong>mute a stream</strong>, you can see the contents if you click on it,
but you won’t get notifications.  If you <strong>mute a topic</strong>, it will be
hidden from view but you can later unmute it in your personal
settings.  Under stream settings, you can request email notifications
for all messages in a certain stream (possibly useful for the announce
streams).</p>

<div class="section" id="reacting-and-voting">
<span id="voting"></span><h3>Reacting and voting<a class="headerlink" href="#reacting-and-voting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We want everyone to take part in chat and express their thoughts, but
of course people don’t want to give pointless agreeing replies (but
you can always welcome to do that, too).  So, we encourage everyone to
use reactions in cases they want to express agreement/disagreement but
not so much they want to send a message.  Common reactions you might
see are 👍, 👎 (thumbs up/down, agree with general sentiment), 🐙
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:octopus:</span></code>, awesome/amazing/ace), and well, plenty more that are
obvious.</p>
<p>We also use reactions to express some idea of a more concrete
<strong>vote</strong>, to empower people to take an action (otherwise, it is
difficult to get a decision on anything).  This is not formal or
necessarily binding (so it’s not really a vote), but a useful
intermediate system for a young project.  If you see a message
proposing something and you want to say, in no uncertain terms, “I
think you should do that” or not, let us know by the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>↔️ (+0, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:left_right:</span></code>: I see this and am neutral.</p></li>
<li><p>🔼, 🔽 (+1, -1, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:upvote:</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:downvote:</span></code>) or similar: I
agree/disagree with this.</p></li>
<li><p>⏬, ⏫ (+2, -2, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:double_up:</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:double_down:</span></code>): I agree/disagree
with this and am willing to work on making it happen/finding an
alternative.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to do something, ask for opinions, and a reasonable time
later it seems the sentiment is positive, consider yourself empowered
to do it.  If you are voting, feel free to be creative with emojis or
numbers, but realize that other reactions may not be so explicit.  Note
that if you are negative, you should explain why or alternatives,
otherwise your opinion may not be weighted so much.  The person doing
the thing decides what to do (and this is open source: we find a way
for everyone to do what they need to do).</p>
<p>Do you think you aren’t important enough to vote?  That’s wrong,
because we are usually interested in the thoughts of outsiders.  We
can see who voted and use that to weight our decision if needed.</p>

<p>CodeRefinery is an open-source project.  All our work is open, and we
accept any type of contributions: there is a lot more than instructing
to run a successful workshop.</p>
<p>If you aren’t sure you are ready for more, you can always {doc}<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lurk</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">chat</span> <span class="pre">&lt;chat&gt;</span></code>

<p>These manuals (and in general, other guides we have) describe the
past, not (only) the future.  They are made so that new people can
know what we typically have done, so they can work on the future (even
if it’s different).</p>

we are happy with pure volunteers, but we accept that most people have
another job and if you can get benefits for your job, you’ll have much
more time for CodeRefinery.</p>
<p>Clearly, these aren’t the only ways to contribute, but we thought that
giving some concrete plans will help people:</p>

<p>As a helper, you have less demands outside of workshops, but you get
to become very familiar with CodeRefinery material.  You especially
get skills in mentoring and debugging.  This is a perfect position for
the “local expert” of a research group, who will guide all of their
members through getting started with scientific computing.  A helper
can include all of our non-instructor roles: helper, expert helper,
Zoom host, etc.</p>

eye on them and make sure issues and pull requests go thorough.  While
theoretically everyone helps with this, it’s good to have someone keep
a close watch and make sure there is an overall order to things.  In
return, you get extensive experience in the topic and experience
working on an open source project.</p>
<p>Quite often, the current maintainer is the person who last did a major
re-working of the lesson and an instructor (either active or at the
final limits of their activity).</p>
<p>Example time commitment: 20-50 hours/year/lesson, plus attending our
yearly CodeRefinery workshop and meetings several times a month.</p>
<p>How to get started: Watch the GitHub issues and be the first one to
answer them.  Review pull requests, and if things make sense to you
then submit a review saying “Approved”.  Eventually, you become the
recognized specialist.  Ask us or we’ll notice, and ask you to become

<div class="section" id="history">
<h3>History<a class="headerlink" href="#history" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>CodeRefinery began as a Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC)
based off of some previous workshops at the KTH, Stockholm.  The first
round of funding was from 2016 - 2018, and a second round is going from
2018-2021.  Thus, so far, it has always had some paid staff (each up
to 0.5 full-time equivalent of their primary jobs).  Most of these
staff are from some sort of computing center.</p>
<p>Over time, it has evolved into a more open project direction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="governance">
<h3>Governance<a class="headerlink" href="#governance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There is a steering group within NeIC which governs the CodeRefinery
project.  However, strictly speaking that mainly covers activities done
via NeIC funding.  The materials and open-source project is open to all.</p>
<p>There are currently no formal decision making processes.  Typically,
decisions related to some repository go through the process of…</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Submit an issue or pull request</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss in the issue and/or</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss in a CodeRefinery team meeting</p></li>
<li><p>If there is rough consensus, then commit it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In general, most decisions (of the open project) result in some sort
of commit in git.  If the reaction is positive in a CodeRefinery
meeting, then it’s accepted.  (Most day-to-day things aren’t discussed
in the meetings, only major things affecting the whole project.)
In general, if you are open and discuss, then do what will improve the
project for you.</p>

<p>We are focused around the material we make, and for that, most
discussion happens in Github issues.  For more abstract discussion on
lessons, there is a topic in the #lessons chat corresponding to each
lesson.</p>

<div class="section" id="decisions">
<h3>Decisions<a class="headerlink" href="#decisions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There is no formal process of decisions.  It should be brought up in
chat, then brought up in a meeting.  In the meeting, be very clear
about what you need a decision or advice on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="core-team">
<h3>Core team<a class="headerlink" href="#core-team" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There is currently no formal “core team” - only those who are most
active.  If you hang around, contribute a lot, you will end up being
seen as “core”.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="joining">
<h3>Joining<a class="headerlink" href="#joining" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There is currently no formal joining process.  Take part, and
contribute as you would like.</p>
<p>The usual way of joining would be to decide how CodeRefinery has to
adapt to serve your needs, and start proposing ways to do that.
Reading existing pull requests and giving a comment of “approve” is a
great way to get noticed.</p>
